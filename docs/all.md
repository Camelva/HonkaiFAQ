## War Treasury
tags: war treasury, wt

::: tip
Make sure you get 2 Dorm guarantees before buying cards from WT, or opening S-rank egg
:::

### Ancient Willpower valks
- First get SSS LE
- None of the other valks are very good to invest in for use in battle
- Prioritize remaining valks and ranks according to their dorm buff increase over cost; check ["!faq dorm buff"](/faq/107)
- To that end, I recommend S MC and S BN first

### Ancient Legacy valks
- Currently pretty tricky to invest in because FR and ME are both old (and of course CH, HR, HV, and SK are very old)
- If you're not even lv 81 yet, might be good to just save your Ancient Legacy.
- FR and ME should both be SSS-rank (or v close) to be competent.
- If you must, I think ME could be a good bet. It would certainly be a gamble though.
- FR is the best farmable lightning valk, good lightning support, but best on nothing. One path you can take is skipping HT, IO, Aponia and just farm FR copium while waiting for future options.
- ME is currently top phys damage dealer in some situations. The bet for investing in her would be on Mihoyo not giving us a better option for Ranged-weak Tank.
- Some more text for the people who like reading: https://discord.com/channels/418652140454674432/901268521181401108/927433678387286036
- Very safe to invest in SS SK for the dorm buff.

### Income and farming speed
- Look for ["!faq ancient"](/faq/102) for details
- In 1 year of play, it is possible to get two SSS-rank Ancient Willpower valks and more

### S-rank egg
- Ideally, save this egg until you have only 1 valk that you do not have
- If you're a little more impatient, you can open it as soon as you finished your 2 Dorm guarantees, and pick a valk you do not own according to your farming priority
- Picking an unowned valk roughly saves you 5 weeks of Ancient Willpower income


## Damage Types
tags: damage, damage types

There are 11 multiplier categories, though most valkyries don't use all of them at the same time, and some of these don't actually exist yet. The categories in bold are true multipliers - they never dilute, only multiply, even with themselves.

1. Physical Damage Dealt
2. Physical Damage Taken
3. Elemental Damage Dealt
4. Elemental Damage Taken
5. Total Damage Dealt
6. Total Damage Taken
7. Typing Bonus
8. Dirac Weather Typing Bonus
9. **Host Specific Physical Taken Debuff**
10. **Host Specific Elemental Taken Debuff**
11. **Host Specific Total Taken Debuff**

Any bonuses within a single category add together. Anything from seperate categories multiplies together to give the final result.

As an small example, assuming no other bonuses, having $20\%$ physical and $20\%$ physical just gives $40\%$ physical as your final result. Having $20\%$ physical and $20\%$ TDM gives you $1.2 \times 1.2 = 1.44 = 44\%$ damage increase as final result.

For true multipliers, they multiply by their stated amount regardless. As an example, Thales M gives $2\%$ host fire taken per stack, up to 10 stacks. Standalone, this is $1.02^{10} \approx 1.22$, not $1.02 \times 10 = 1.2$.


## Pity
tags: pity, how pity works

### This is how the 10 pull pity counter works:
Most supplies have a hidden counter that ranges from 0 to 9. Every time you pull and don't get a rare outcome, the counter increases. If you do get a rare outcome, it resets to 0. if the counter reaches 9, your next pull is a guaranteed rare outcome.

- For focused, a rare is a 4★ weapon or stig.
- For expansion, rare is a valkyrie card.

As a result, x1 and x10 are literally the same thing, but x1 offers you the benefit of being able to stop early if you get what you want before 10 pulls.


## Expedition
tags: expedition

Expeditions are the primary way of farming most standard A-rank Valkyries. You can find expeditions by going to Attack > Story > Expeditions tab. Completing an expedition stage has a chance of dropping a fragment of the target Valkyrie. Go to Dorm > Expeditions to deploy Valkyries to auto-run expedition stages for you. 

Every Valkyrie has multiple "Acts" (stages) and each Act has either 2 or 3 max attempts per day. The number of max attempts is also the pity counter, i.e. for a 2-attempt Act you're guaranteed at least one fragment every 2 runs, and for a 3-attempt Act you're guaranteed at least one fragment every 3 runs. This pity count remains even if you don't use all attempts in one day. 

Different Acts also cost different amounts of stamina to run so you want to run the more cost-effective Acts first. Since the pity is 2 for some Acts and 3 for others, it's not as simple as running Acts that cost less stamina. Instead multiply the stamina cost by the number of max attempts to get the stamina cost to guarantee a fragment. Then run the stages that have the lowest cost first.


## Fragments
tags: frag, frags

### To get more Valkyrie Fragments
For suits you don't own: Menu > Valkyries > tap the one you don't own > tap Get. If nothing displays, she isn't farmable.

For suits you do own, tap them, then tap their current rank and cp indicator to bring up their status screen. Tap Get under the Rank Up progress bar.

Duplicate character cards will be converted to fragments. The amount of fragments received for a duplicate is below.

### **Base:**
- B: 7
- A: 18
- S: 30

### **Awakened:**
- A: 30
- S: 70

### **SP:**
- A: 30


## QTE Timers
tags: qte

When you perform a QTE skill, it doubles the cooldown for the valk switching out. So if valk A is on field and you QTE to valk B, you must wait twice as long before valk A can come back onto the field (4s with no QTE vs 8s with qte).

That's why you don't want to QTE from your damage dealer to a support, and you should generally turn off the QTE skill for the support that comes in right after your damage dealer.


## How Isaac Newton (B) Works
tags: newt, newt B, newton, newton B

When the holder of Newton B strikes an enemy, it places something called "Challenge Mode" on that enemy for 5 seconds. While an enemy has Challenge, indicated by a flame icon over their head, the enemy's attacks deal 41% more damage, but the enemy takes 31% more damage too.

## HoV worth to be invested in?
tags: hov

### **IS HOV WORTH INVESTING IN?**

*No, she's not worth investing in anymore.*

She simply doesn't have a place in the meta anywhere anymore, even at SSS rank. The main reason for that is **not** as many people assume Elysia, they are completely different and cannot be compared in most cases, but instead Silverwing. The one place where HoV was meta up until Silverwing's release was Ranged weather Assaka boss in Superstring Dimension (EX Abyss), but due to temperatures being extremely high nowadays, Assaka's shield in that stage has become a big problem especially when we take into consideration the very tiny delay that shield has until it completely regenerates, therefore you're better off using Silverwing to completely bypass the shield, thanks to her elemental damage.

*Note: This FAQ was written by an SSS HoV user.*


## Abbreviations
tags: abbr, abbreviations, glossary

https://honkaiimpact3.gamepedia.com/Glossary_of_Terms


## Time Fractures and other Time Effects
tags: tf

### Time Slow
Time Slow is a status effect that greatly slows the target. This also extends any applicable debuffs on the target by slowing down the counter for them. Newton, Mei, and all of CH's impair methods are not applicable, for example; they don't get extended. Stuff like Mjolnir or DP impair does get extended.

### Time Lock
Time Lock temporarily freezes the target in time, immobilizing them completely as well as halting the timer for any applicable debuffs on them. It's basically a 100% Time Slow.

### Time Fracture
Time Fracture slows the entire world, applying time slow to all enemies and also slowing the game clock. This latter effect is incredibly important for Memorial Arena, where scores on bosses are determined by the game clock time.

### Time Stop
Time Stop pauses all game timers, like stage and buff timers, it essentially allows characters to have exciting animations without impacting your gameplay. Characters who do not have timestops (older characters) can sometimes get new weapons that enable timestops for them.

### Suspended Animation
This is a community term for animations that slow the score clock timer in memorial arena, but are not a time fracture. Buffs/Debuffs still move in real time during these effects. It's similar to time stops in why it exists, to allow for cool animations without hurting your time too much. Kind of like a beta version of timestop.

### Bow Aiming
This time slowing effect slows everything, in this respect it's similar to both time stops and suspended animation. By slowing everything across the board, it gives the player a fair chance to aim without worrying about losing too much time. Time also doesn't pass quickly, so makesure your timing is good when you start, or you could miss your target.


## Crit damage
tags: crt, crit

$$Crit Rate = \frac{CRT}{(Valk Level \times 5 + 75)} + Crit Rate Buffs$$
For example, a level 80 valkyrie with $CRT = 140$ has a crit rate of $140 / 475 = 29.5\%$ prior to crit rate buffs.

$$Crit Dmg Multiplier = 2 + Crit Dmg Buffs$$
For example, Empyrea Phoenix (B) by itself results in $Crit Dmg Multiplier = 2.25$ for the team after the holder uses a Combo atk. This means that critical hits do $2.25$ times the damage of non-critical hits.


## Evasion
tags: evasion

### Evasion Action (Evade)
Evasion Action is pressing the button. Some valks, like KMB and GK (HoV), can trigger their Evasion Skill with their evasion action without performing an ultimate evade.

### Ultimate Evasion (UE)
Ultimate Evasion is using Evasion Action to dodge through an active hitbox. Specifically, the hitbox of the attack must come in contact with the Valkyrie's hurtbox. This distinction is important, as there are valks whose Evasion Actions can actually dodge hitboxes entirely, such as Roza's - if she outright avoids the attack by teleporting underneath it, it will not trigger an Ultimate Evasion.

### Perfect Defense
If the Valkyrie instead puts up a shield, then depending on the mechanism for defending, there are variants of this for those Valkyries. Bronya performs Perfect Defense when you shield an attack then immediately drop the shield after the attack is blocked. BK has a unique Retaliation mechanic in addition to a standard dash-type evasion action.

### Evasion Skill
Evasion Skill is an ability tied to evasion. For most valks, it activates automatically if it is not on CD and you perform an Ultimate Evasion or Perfect Defense.

## Evadion (Q-Singularity)
Evadion is built by either performing Retaliation, Perfect Defense, or an Ultimate Evasion - however, Ultimate Evasions can only earn Evadion once per internal evasion cooldown for that character.


## What to Get From an S Rank Egg? (Outdated)
tags: egg

***IMPORTANT: Before you choose any Valkyries from the free S rank egg or from Land of Wishes eggs, WAIT until get your first 2 guaranteed S ranks from dorm supply (S ranks guaranteed within 25 pulls). Who you get from dorm supply may affect who you want to choose from the egg.***

### **OVERVIEW:**
There are 3 valkyries that you want to get as soon as possible, KMB, LE, and PX. You have 3 eggs. If necessary, you use the 3 eggs to get those 3 Valkyries. However, if you pull any of those 3 Valkyries from dorm supply, it allows you to choose someone else from the free egg. The next best Valkyrie to get after those 3 is MC.

### **THEREFORE**:
1) If you don’t get any of those 3 valkyries from dorm supply…
    - Free egg: KMB
    - Land of Wishes 1: LE
    - Land of Wishes 2: PX

2) If you get LE and/or KMB from dorm supply…
    - Free egg: MC
    - Land of Wishes 1: LE/KMB (whichever you don’t have, LE dupe if you have both)
    - Land of Wishes 2: PX

3) If you get PX but not LE or KMB from dorm supply
    - Free egg: KMB
    - Land of Wishes 1: LE
    - Land of Wishes 2: (See Note)

4) If you can manage to get KMB, LE, PX, and MC without having to use the free egg, then choose SK from the free egg.

**NOTE:**
If in any scenario, you get PX from dorm supply, hold off on doing second Land of Wishes.

## Attack types (outdated)
tags: attack types

Gauntlet/Dual guns/Katana users can use combo attacks.

Greatsword/Heavy weapon/Cross/Scythe/Lance/Bow users can use charged attacks.

The only exceptions are: GK, SA, IO, and SNS, whom have the opposite of the norm for their weapon type.

If a valkyrie can perform combo attacks, then they cannot perform charged attacks and the reverse is also true.

Note that using charged attacks will not satisfy "kill an enemy with combo attacks" and the reverse is also true; combo attacks will not satisfy "kill an enemy with charged attacks."

> notes for updating: generalize more, probably explain how to check in-game instead of just assuming based on weapon.


## Blood Dance holder
tags: bd, bd holder

The best Blood Dance (BD) holder depends on the team and situation. The main factors to consider are the following:
- **Time fracture:**

    In MA it may be useful to use a BD holder that has time fracture on evasion, e.g. MC and BS.
- **Switch skills:**

    Valkyries with no switch skill (e.g. VK, MC, BB) can be better BD holders since they won't apply JST/newt B prematurely with switch in attacks.
- **QTE skills:**

    QTE skills can be useful to provide time fracture and further trigger the QTE of your dps (e.g. SF).
- **Typing:**

    Sometimes you need a BD holder of a particular type in order to satisfy lead skills, e.g. use a psy BD holder for LE HF team and for HoT teams, or use a BD holder whose type will satisfy AE lead in applicable teams.


## Awakened valks
tags: awaken

The "Awakened" class of valks are essentially a seperate battlesuit that is linked to its "Unawakened" valk  (e.g. HoV = Awakened, KMB = Non-awakened)
Valks that share a link share levels, some skills, and cannot be used in the same team.

What isn't shared are some skills, Valkyrie rank, and gear. Despite not sharing rank, it can sometimes be useful to rank up one valk to unlock a shared skill on the other.

Awakened Valkyries take more resources to rank up, and increase their skills.

Note that despite the title of "Awakening", Awakened valks are not direct improvements to their unawakened counterparts, take it as simply the Awakening/Unawakened valkyries simply being linked on some qualities, but otherwise being completely seperate battlesuits


## Branch attack (combo, charged)
tags: combo attack, charged attack, branch attack

Each valk has either "Combo Atk" or "Charged Atk", never both
Whether a valk uses Combo or Charged is explicitly written in the valk's skill tree

Combo (分支 i.e. "Branch") Atk users:
- Fist, Pistols, Blade wielders and SA, IO, SW

Charged (蓄力) Atk users:
- Greatsword, Heavy (cannon), Cross, Scythe, Lance, Bow wielders and GK, Carole

Extra notes:
- Using Charged Atk will not satisfy "Kill an enemy with Combo Atks" and vice versa.
- Combo Atk is an independent concept from the Combo Hit Count (top left corner counter).

## Server Maintenance
tags: mtkek

To check on server maintenance for your respective server, please go to [#mt-countdown](https://discord.com/channels/418652140454674432/915429456473120818) for information!

## Wrong server
tags: wrong server

**Has your progress "reset" when you enter the game?**

If you login after the update and see that all of your valkyries and equipment are wrong, you have probably logged onto the wrong server. On the "Tap anywhere to enter the game." screen, check the top right to see if you are on the correct server.


## Katana Choice
tags: katana choice

Newer players: hold until lv 81+, as all of these weapons only have use at lv 81+, and you may off-rate some of the weapons before then.

At lv 81+,
1. MagStorm to make PRI-ARM MagTyphoon, a lightning support weapon useful on several strats, usually whenever LE is used, e.g. with DP, BD, FR, HF, HT
1. Demonblade - Florid Sakura to make PRI-ARM Ruinous Sakura, a niche fire support weapon
3. Whatever weapon you do not have and use Reson-Convert from the Asterite Shop to convert into Weapon Resonance.


## Time Capsule (outdated)
tags: time capsule

What to pick from time capsule:
1. **Theresa: Summer Holic T** and **Himeko: Summer Day M**

    Used on BD holders and LE usually. Any elemental support that would run JST can run these with little modification to play style. Usually referred to as Balloon.
2. **Xuanyuan Pistols**

    Only if you don't have Mjolnir or similar, useful for triggering qtes like TP's
3. **Durandal Vacation M**

    Decent f2p tdm stig, bummer about the SP regen reduction, so be wary where you put it


## Growth Fund
tags: growth fund

```toml
[Growth Fund]
Captains level 6+ can purchase.
Captains that are above the level of the perks can automatically claim them. 

Ex. CL 80 can purchase a Growth Fund and claim all of the gold/crystals.
```


## Gamepath
tags: gamepath

**(PC) All paths of Honkai Impact 3rd:**
- **Settings** (in registry. WIN+R > regedit): `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\miHoYo\Honkai Impact 3rd`

- **Game** (Default Path): `C:\Program Files\Honkai Impact 3rd\Games\`


## Difficulty (Story EZ)
tags: difficulty, storyjoke

> This FAQ may not be correct, it was the only use I could find.

When providing advice, we almost always give it under the assumption that it is for competitive Memorial Arena and Abyss. In a game mode like Story or Co-op, literally anything will function there and they are not modes where you can really gauge the strength of gear/valkyries accurately.

## How outfit bingo works
tags: bingo

A board containing the outfit may appear after you obtain the top prize on at least 3 boards. A board containing the top prize must appear after obtaining the top prize on at least 5 boards.

The expected number of tile flips to obtain the top prize is 12.9 flips. Each tile flip is an independent event. The likelihood of any tile flip yielding the top prize is 3%. There is a 63.3% chance that all 16 tiles must be flipped. This expected number of flips is calculated as `sum(xP(x),1<=x<=16)`, where `P(x)=0.97^(x-1)*0.03` and `P(16)=0.633=1-sum(P(x),1<=x<=15)`.

*If there is a secret soft pity, it is not known and has not been considered here.*

It is expected to take 51.4 keys to clear 4 boards. It is expected to take 77.1 keys to clear 6 boards.

Keys can be bought for 60 crystals each.


## Reroll
tags: reroll

You spend ~2 hours for a roughly 11k-Crystal head start, i.e. ~1 month worth of F2P Crystal income.

During rare events the game gives 5 cards to players unconditionally. This is a great time to reroll! It takes less time and you only spend half of your beginner Crystals.

How to reroll:
- Each run is about 15-20 minutes. Pull on the target banner while earning Crystals.

Choosing target supply:
1. Ideally, Expansion Supply for Herrscher Senti
2. Expansion Supply for another recent S-rank might be good; better ask if it's good
3. Starter Supply, but if you're aiming for Herrscher Senti it could take longer

## What is a PRI-ARM?
tags: pri what

PRI-ARMs are weapons that can be forged at lv 81 or higher and have 6 stars when maxed.

To unlock the recipe for a PRI-ARM, you must have its corresponding non-PRI-ARM weapon in your collection (i.e. you've owned it at some point).

Materials consumed when forging a PRI-ARM:
- A lv 50 bounty or gacha weapon of the same type as the PRI-ARM
    > **Divine Key PRI-ARMs must consume their corresponding non-PRI-ARM**
- 100 Torus
- 15 Nanoceramic
- 50 SC Metal-H2

## Expeditions
tags: expeditions

Quick expedition farming guide

1. Pity counter of N where N is the number of allowed daily attempts, i.e. you are guaranteed the Frag in N or fewer completions.
2. As is usual for pity, the counter resets on a drop of the Frag. However, the counter does not reset at daily server reset.
3. Very low, seemingly fixed chance of Frag drop on non-pity completion.

Thus,
1. Prefer expedition with the lowest stamina cost for pity, i.e. the lowest N x S where S is the stamina per attempt.
2. If two expeditions have the same N x S, prefer the one with the greater N.
3. It is best to use all allowed daily attempts even if you get the Frag before the Nth completion, unless of course you have already finished your farming goal.

## All about Stamina Regen
tags: stamina regen

- gain `300` stamina per day for free
- `300 = 10 per hour x 24 hours + 30 (mei lunch) + 30 (mei dinner)`
- paying `25` crystals for `60` stam is not good if you're on a budget
- ~~adventure commander is a good deal~~ (stamina pot subscription removed)
- avoid letting your stamina exceed the denominator, i.e. for `X/Y` stam, `X` should be be kept smaller than `Y`.
- when `X >= Y` ("overcapped"), stamina regen is no longer `10` per hour. instead, it is `10 x 35% = 3.5` per hour. (yours may be greater than `35%`)
- `Y = your captain level + 80`
- the absolute max value of `X = your captain level + 560`


## Rough growing account Resonance priority
tags: reson, resonance, exchange

### Weapon Resonance
0. Torus - I recommend most players to wait for Exalted before buying weapons. You need like 50k+ Reson for your PRI-ARMs, and this is the more impactful way to spend your Reson. You may off-rate many of the below weapons.
1. Nebulous Duality
2. Blood Dance - strong ele support weapon on SS bosses in MA
3. Oath of Judah - global +10 Atk
4. Thunder Kikaku - lightning support weapon in MA
5. Swan Lake or Sleeping Beauty - limited use weapon
6. Key of Reason, Mjolnir, Nuada's Grief - very niche or low use weapons

### Stigma Resonance

2. Newton B
3. Mei: Beach Party M
4. Newton B
5. Mei: Beach Party M

## ELI5: How does X affect my damage?
tags: dmg, eli5damage, eli5dmg

**In general, damage is the product of several factors**

**In general, when we equip something we add a number to one of the factors**

For example, damage done to an enemy who is in Challenge mode (Newton B's effect) is calculated with 0.31 added to the `Total Dmg Taken` factor.

Main factors to be concerned about:
Damage = `some mysterious starting number`
- × `Ele Dmg Dealt` IF Ele
- × `Ele Dmg Taken` IF Ele
- × `Phys Dmg Dealt` IF Phys
- × `Phys Dmg Taken` IF Phys
- × `Crit Dmg` IF Phys AND Crit
- × `Total Dmg Dealt`
- × `Total Dmg Taken`
- × `Weather Effect`
- × `Type Effect`
- × `Ele Resist Effect` IF Ele
- × `Phys Resist Effect` IF Phys

Other than these, there are also some unique factors, often described in game as "independent effect"

Each factor is 1 when valk, gear, stage effects are not included, except `Crit Dmg`, which starts at 2

`Weather Effect` is often 1.5 for advantageous type. However, some Abyss Weathers increase a different factor like `Total Dmg Dealt` instead of `Weather Effect`.

`Type Effect` is 1.3 for type advantage and either 0.7 or 1/1.3 for type disadvantage

`some mysterious starting number is usually` a statement like this,
>"deals 2400% of Atk as Fire Dmg"

which means that you take the valk's Atk × 24 as the starting number.

`Ele Resist Effect` is just a number less than or equal to 1
based on the enemy's Ele Resist,

e.g. `Ele Resist Effect` = 0.28 for Jizo, who has 72% Ele Resist.

`Phys Resist Effect` = `1 / (1 + (Def / (300 + 20 * Lv)))`, 
where Def is the enemy's Def and Lv is your valk's Lv.


## What makes DK so good?
tags: dk why


1) Uncharged bolt makes enemies take 50% more shield damage
2) Very long time fracture on block
3) Each block also restores 6 sp for the whole team
4) Uncharged bolt weakens, great for QTE triggers (e.g. FT, SN) and passives (e.g. FT buffed against weakened enemies)
5) Whole team's melee attacks gain 25% physical damage and 10% crit rate as long as shield is active
6) Did I mention she has a shield? Some added QoL and also can make it more consistent to maintain Lier B buff
7) QTE and ULT gathers enemies which can be useful for abyss mobbing teams
8) Can hold Briareus EX. This weapon provides impair and also keeps DK on field which lets her consistently reapply Newton B and Picasso debuff effects.
9) Nice lead skill too


## In-game gacha rates
tags: rates

These are the rates presented in the in-game announcements.

The in-game rates are inclusive of pity. This is to say that the rate on non-pity pulls are much lower, e.g. we think Expansion Supply S card is 0.6% on a non-pity pull.

Based on research, we think there is soft pity that increases the drop rate above 80 pulls, and this is not counted in the in-game rates.

### Focused Supply individual rates

- Trash: 42.68%

### Expansion Supply Equipment individual rates
- Each UP weapon: 1.83%
- Each UP stigma: 0.92%
- Each 4* weapon (non-UP): 0.46%

## All about captain level
tags: level up, break through, break the ceiling, experience, rush

### How do I gain levels faster? How does exp work?
- In general, 1 exp = 1 stamina spent
- You get multipliers on exp gained when you are low level; see the active multipliers by clicking on the up arrow on your profile
- Adventure Tasks are not affected by multipliers
- You also get exp for claiming Daily BP, by an amount that is stated on the BP, and this exp gained is affected by multipliers
- Claiming finished passive Expeditions are affected by multipliers, calculated at the time of claiming rather than starting the Expedition
- In other words, the best way to level up is just by doing daily tasks and things that require stamina

### Should I rush leveling up?
It is best to claim as much Captain Exp as possible from your daily farming.

Prior to v4.2, the best advice was to level up as slowly as possible while claiming 150 Daily Duty, which was basically the old version of Daily BP. This is because Masters Abyss included players lv 70 to 85 (with 85 being the former max level), where players lv 81 to 85 had PRI-ARMs. Thus, passing lv 70 was an enormous spike in competition, and it was impossible to place high enough to match the rewards obtained from Elites (lv 56 to 69).

However, that is since changed, and now Masters, regardless of Abyss or Arena, comprises lv 70 to 80 players only. It is "like entering Elites again".

Regardless of your skill level, moving up a tier will result in an increase in Crystal gain. For example, a player who retains Agony in Elites is likely to retain Agony in Masters. At the very least, the player will alternate between Sinful and Agony. Both situations reward more Crystals than retaining Agony in Elites.

Looking at it from another angle, a 180-day player who level rushed is far more likely to retain Red Lotus in Masters than a 180-day player who didn't. The two players may have tried to farm the same gear, but the player who used Exp Chips is higher level and so has more attack, and the player has also earned more rewards (e.g. Ancient Willpower, Crystals) in the 180 days thanks to entering better-rewarding tiers earlier.

Furthermore, if your intention is to break through, it is better to enter Exalted (lv 81+) as soon as possible to begin farming PRI-ARM upgrade mats.

### What is breaking through?
- Starting from lv 80 you can choose whether to "break the ceiling", which allows you to advance to level 81. Without breaking, you will always be held at level 80.
- You can choose to do so whenever you want, but you can never reverse your decision.

### Should I stay in Masters?
- In masters it's easier to top score with farmable Valkyries (e.g. VD, BB, HF, DK, DP, NS) whereas in Exalted it's much harder to compete without Gacha Valkyries.
- Good scores (i.e. close to cap scores) in Masters are attainable using a variety of options, whereas good scores in Exalted have very little flexibility when it comes to gacha valks and gear.
- No need to worry about Dorm Level and Divine Keys, which are built up over hundreds of days of playing and provide older players with strong universal account buffs.
- No need to worry about PRI-ARMs and the hard-to-obtain materials needed to upgrade them.
- Hoyoverse frequently updates Exalted Abyss with new bosses and weathers that cater to the newest Valkyries, whether the Valks are gacha or otherwise.
- No need to worry about SSS bosses, which are usually very difficult without the latest Gacha Valkyries.

### Should I break through to Exalted?
- High spenders will get bored quickly in Masters because they will very quickly be able to reach the top few spots in Arena and Abyss, where they may even sometimes find F2P players easily outscoring them because F2P valks may do better on Masters bosses.
- The same account will earn marginally more rewards in Exalted Abyss, even if it places lower, since Exalted rewards are better. These rewards include Crystals, Ancient Legacy, and Ancient Willpower.
- Hoyoverse frequently updates Exalted Abyss with new bosses and weathers, whereas Masters Abyss gets updated more slowly. (Good or bad depending on your preferences.)
- Get to play with PRI-ARMs, which often have fun mechanics.
- Materials useful to all players, like Ancient Legacy and Affix Lock mats are scarce in Masters.
- Elysian Realm is slightly easier with PRI-ARMs.

### If I have decided to break through, when should I do it?
- If you commit to breaking through, it is best to break through as soon as possible to begin farming PRI-ARM upgrade mats. A lot of how well someone can do in Exalted depends on their PRI-ARM availability, and it's hence better to begin collecting and leveling PRIs as soon as possible to catch up with older players



## Salvage Mats (outdated)
tags: salvage mats

- Twin Sakura Will until you have 1/3 as many Twin Sakura Will as Phase Shifters
- Adv Skill Mats until 30 to 80 depending on how whale you are (whales need more)
- Nanoceramic so that you have ~45 per 100 Torus
- Always salvage with energy

> Will be outdated as of the materials conversion in 6.2

Hi Captain,
Thanks for asking a question! In order to better answer you, Ai-chan needs some more background.
Please consider providing some or all of the following information.
- Your captain level:
- The team you are using, i.e. the 3 valks, their ranks, their gear, ELF:
- The enemy you're trying to beat and the stage conditions, e.g. buffs, debuffs, special stage skills:
- Your Abyss league: Sinful / Agony / Red Lotus
- Your typical MA finishing %:
- Your spending tier, e.g. in USD per month:


## Battlesuits
tags: : battlesuit

**"Why You Should Be Specific About Which Battlesuits You're Talking About When Asking Questions; The distinctions between Characters and Battlesuits"**

In Honkai, several of the playable Valkyries have alternate forms, these are called "battlesuits".
For example, Knight Moonbeam is a battlesuit of Kiana's, and so is Divine Prayer.

While initially there may be much confusion on how the battlesuit system works, it's really just simple and easier to look at battlesuits as completely seperate entities in gameplay. (Even if they share the same Character!)

Many battlesuits that share the same Character (e.g. Umbral Rose and Argent Knight: Artemis; Rita) still have very different applications in Gameplay, and assuming that just because 2 Battlesuits are of the same character, that they are comparable in Role and Gameplay Usage, is usually not a good idea, as Battlesuits can be incredibly varied in usage.


## Elemental Reactions
tags: reaction

Elemental damage has no direct interations with other elements. Some content may have elements which have an advantage, or an elemental status condition. 

EX: Cryo enemies don't usually take extra Pyro damage.

Elemental Damage cannot Critically hit, but it by-passes Shields(yellow) and the DEF stat. Make sure to read stage descriptions for advantaged types.


## Desirable affixes (outdated)
tags: affix

1. Gain Atk. Unless otherwise specified, just aim for all Atk affix lines on your dmg valks.
2. Gain Crit Dmg. This is usually comparably valuable to gain Atk, in some cases better, but only Phys can Crit. Because affix mats are expensive, would take this along with gain Atk on Phys valks.
3. SP regen near enemies. In rare cases useful on dmg valks for some SP-tight runs. Generally useful on support valks.
4. Attacks do X Fire/Ice/Lightning Dmg. To exploit SK taking more Phys when hit by ele dmg or break shields based on number of hits.
5. Activating skills costs less SP - Occasionally needed on valks. Good example is Kikaku DP. Don't gimp yourself out of Margrave condition.
Final note: affixes can be 2-diamond or 3-diamond. 3-diamond goes up to 23 Atk per affix, up to 5.6% Crit Dmg.
Some more detail: 

> Update note: Just modernize it.


## About Firepower Supply: what is it and is it worth rolling?
tags: firepower

### **What is Firepower Supply?**
Firepower Supply is a unique Supply that we get once in a while, usually during big events like Anniversaries. It is essentially a custom Supply in which you can pick 5 weapons and 5 stigma sets out of a predetermined pool of gear. You can roll on Firepower once during the period where it’s available, and it will guarantee you one gear piece that you don’t have already have in your collection (or in other words, haven’t owned at any point).

### **Is Firepower Supply worth it?**
If Firepower Supply is worth rolling depends entirely on the state of your account.

It is recommended to roll Firepower Supply if you can select 9 weapons/stigma sets that are already in your collection and one gear piece you don’t already have, hence narrowing your pool essentially to that one gear piece. The best use of your guarantee is on a Divine Key for the universal buffs, or a weapon which rotates into supply with a forgable set (ex: Hekate) so you avoid having to roll for forgable stigmata, or the last piece of a gear set that you already have 3/4 of and are just missing the last piece. In other words, it’s most effectively used to dodge having to roll on a normal Supply in the future entirely if you feel you need the gear from it.

However, it is NOT recommended to roll Firepower Supply if your gear collection is too small to be able to snipe one gear piece of your choosing via the method mentioned above, or if you just simply don’t feel the need for any of the featured gear from it. As I mentioned before, the best way to use Firepower is by using it to avoid having to roll on another Supply later. If you use Firepower Supply to get something like your first piece of a set, there’s a good chance you’ll just get a duplicate of whatever piece you rolled anyway while going for the rest of it.

### **TLDR:**
Firepower Supply is worth it for established accounts that can snipe a gear piece of their choosing, but not worth for those who can’t.


## Understanding Impair ("脆弱")
tags: impair

1. Enemies have DEF. Many Ex MA bosses have `DEF = 996`. The result of DEF on damage is that a factor of `1 / (1 + (DEF / (300 + 20 * lv)))` is multiplied to any damage when the damage is physical. This multiplier is called phys resist effect. lv is the level of the attacking valk. I'll use `lv = 80` for this FAQ, thus `phys resist effect = 1900 / (1900 + DEF)`. For example, when `DEF = 1000`, `phys resist effect = 0.655`, i.e. `0.655` is multiplied to any physical damage.
2. If it helps, `1 - ele resist = ele resist effect` is multiplied to any ele damage just like how `1 - phys resist = phys resist effect` is multiplied to any phys damage.
2. Impair is a reduction in `DEF`, i.e. Impair is a percentage that is deducted. Let's say Impair is `75%` (e.g. CH Ult), so where `DEF = 1000` before Impair, now `DEF = 250` and `phys resist effect = 1900 / (1900 + 250) = 0.884`.
3. `0.884` is a lot better than the `0.655` from before Impair! We can also deduce that dmg increase as a result of impair is `Impair * DEF / (1900 + (1 - Impair) * DEF)`. For `DEF = 1000` and `75%` Impair, that's `750 / (1900 + 250) = 0.349`, which makes sense, as `1.349 * 0.655 = 0.884`.
4. Impair is always expressed as a percentage. As far as is known, all sources of Impair replace previous Impair, except when it says "Impair only when not Impaired", in which case it does nothing. (Only 1 source of Impair can be alive.)
5. **BONUS** Herrscher of Sentience's ultimate can be thought of as constantly refreshing it's own impair, thus it takes priority over any other impairs that might be applied for it's duration.


## Breach 
tags: breach, elemental breach, physical breach, ele breach, phys breach

### Understanding Elemental Breach ("元素穿透")
1. Enemies have ele resist. Most Ex MA bosses have 31%. Jizo has 72%. 31% resist means 0.69 is multiplied to any dmg.
2. Ele Breach is reduction in ele resist, i.e. the number is directly subtracted from ele resist. AE has 14% Ele Breach, so bosses with 31% ele resist have 17% ele resist after 14% Ele Breach.
3. To illustrate the impact of Ele Breach, 31% ele resist with 14% Ele Breach results in `83 / 69 = 1.203` times more damage. 72% ele resist with 14% Ele Breach results in `42 / 28 = 1.5` times more damage. In summary, damage increase as a result of having Ele Breach is `Ele Breach / (1 - ele resist)`
4. Each source of Ele Breach is subtracted from ele resist. For example, 14% from AE Ult and 20% from HR Ult (total 34%) results in Jizo having 38% ele resist and bosses with 31% ele resist having 0 ele resist. Note that ele resist cannot be negative, so Ele Breach is no longer useful once ele resist has been reduced to 0.

> Elemental Breach is additive with Reduced Elemental Resistence

### Understanding Physical Breach ("物理穿透")
1. Physical Breach is, at the time of writing, a concept only available in Elysian Realm.
2. Physical Breach does not behave like Ele Breach. Based on testing, it is the same as Impair. See ["!faq impair"](/faq/85).
3. My best guess for why Physical Breach exists in addition to Impair is that historically Impair has been single instance instead of stacking, so they introduced a different name to show this difference.

> Henlo, this is a little add it to clairify. What makes Physical Breach different than impair, is that breach is a valkyrie stat instead of a debuff like impair. This means they "stack" but with a greatly dimminshed effectiveness. Physical Breach and Impair also stack additively with DEF reduction, which is uncommon, but found in Elysian Realm as well. If you get to 100% in any combination, any more is useless. 

> So 40% DEF Reduction and 60% physical Breach is the same thing as 100% pBreach. But 50% pBreach and a 75% impair is only 87.5% reduced DEF.

> Impair and pBreach visual aid <https://www.desmos.com/calculator/je7d4fxkhr>


## Input Buffer
tags: input buffer

As with all (I guess, almost all) action games with move animation (non-cancelable), when you have to press buttons quickly, there is an input buffer.

i.e. if you press an input, it will be queued and executed at the next opportunity.
*(this is because the game wants you to do moves one after another but can't reasonably expect you to press a button perfectly on the frame after the last move has finished)*

If HF is still doing the end of her last AB, if you input A again, the A will get executed as soon as the AB finishes

however,
1. the input buffer doesn't have unlimited time, and
2. it can only queue 1 input (it feels like 1 to me, so let's go with that)

what this means is
1. if you input the A too early, it'll get queued and then expire before the last AB has finished, and so no A will get executed
2. if you input A and then B before the last AB has finished, the B will overwrite the A and you will get AB and then B

this is true for other moves in this game too

you may find this on DA, whose ults have long, non-cancelable move animation

sometimes you can input something before the last DA ult has finished and it never gets executed (because it has expired)

thus, for hf for example, you should input A as close to the end of the last AB as possible

note that A has a very short animation and B has a very long animation, so you can input B right after A, but you must not do it such that A has not even started, because that would lead to B overwriting the A

::: info Disclaimer: 
this is based on imy's experience; it may not be 100% accurate, but it "feels" like how the game behaves

## Check the pins (polite)
tags: polite pinned

Ai-chan thinks one or more guides in the pins of [💁gameplay-help](https://discord.com/channels/418652140454674432/430057371641970708) would be helpful for you. Please take a look, Captain!

(Captain, you can find the pins on the top right corner. May need to swipe to the left first on mobile.)


## Gacha gear
tags: valk gearing, pulling gear, pulling gacha gear

Most gacha valks need most of their gacha signature equipment by virtue of not being much better or at all better than farmable valks when both use farmable gear.

When you pull a gacha valk without gearing her appropriately, you haven't gained any edge over players who are using only farmable valks!

Don't hesitate to ask for what kind of setups a valk can use!

## How good is X, I saw it in [spoilers]
tags: beta

What you just saw was something from the Beta Server! 

**Beta versions usually undergo meta-significant and fundamental changes to the unit/weapon/gear before it reaches live. It is completely pointless to speculate the strength of something which is still in Beta.**

Furthermore, the true strength of a unit can only be revealed once the dalaos (pros) have gotten them on the live version, and they get to play around with it. Sometimes the beta-testers miss meta things!

Some examples:
- AF numbers were tossed around throughout all 3 Beta patches!
- HT Dragon mode couldn't be exited voluntarily during Beta V1!
- Almost all MA/Abyss rots arn't developed until it hits live! Who knew HS could fight rimestar?


## Gold Pins

asterite worth of gold pins (higher is better)
- ae imaginon: 33.75, highly needed by almost everyone
- purple lens: 33, highly needed for growing account
- sc metal h2: 30, highly needed after lv 81
- dj frag: 25, when you need to farm dj
- phase shifter: 25, not even that scarce, but okay buy
- hb/pv/sa frag: 20, do you even have spare pins at this point?


## PRI leveling
tags: pri leveling

maxing a few pri-arms
- lets you copy runs (you also need good affixes)
- lets you possibly score high on a few bosses
- easier time playing the game, but lower score

level more pri-arms evenly
- won't be able to copy strats because nobody makes them for your specific pri-arm level
- lets you score evenly across all bosses
- takes time, effort and brain to figure out your own runs for those high scores

my overall recommendation is the former. you can have an easier time playing the game, get used to copying strats (what top players do) instead of inventing new strats every week and then discarding them soon after. you may even score overall higher if you have less time to play the game.


## Future banners

what to buy from witch's corridor
- see [!faq shop](/faq/35)
- wo => ncc
- pwo => stamps, frags of non-farmable S-ranks, wafer stabilizer, wafer dataflow

farming ncc
- farming wo to buy ncc is the largest f2p source of ncc
- 300 wo => 300 ncc
- expeditions for ns, va, vb, ya are 36 stam for at least 60 wo, recommended to do at least ns, va every day once you max dorm level
- from battle arsenal, gold pins => dj frags => wo => ncc has the same rate as gold pins => ncc
- memorial arena eggs can be used for frags for ncc, but I recommend this only after you've SSS-ed all of the valks


## Dorm buff
tags: dorm buff

These are permanent and global buffs that are enabled simply by owning the dorm S-rank valks at certain ranks. The valk that gives the buff does not have to be in a team for the buff to be active.

These buffs stack additively, just like how buffs usually work.

### How to check your current buffs:

## Divine Keys (What)
tags: dkey what

### What are they? 
they are weapons that are either found in co-op raid or ones from dkey gacha/exchange. There are currently 7 dkey categories with their respective dkeys:

- Key of Binding - Oath of Judah, Pledge of Sakura
- Key of Creation - Abyss flower, Abyss 
- Key of Corruption - Jizo Mitama
- Key of Domination - Grips of TaiXuan, XuanYuan Sword
- Key of Destruction - Judgement of Shamash, Cleaver of Shamash, Might of An-Utu
- Key of Devouring - Star of Eden, Twins of Eden
- Key of Sentience - Fenghuang Down, Fenghuang Pinions
> note: just because it has "key" in the name doesn't mean its a dkey (kov/koc/koo/kor are NOT dkeys)

You can get active or passive buffs from this, active buffs like gain x ice dmg passive buffs like gain x atk, you need to upgrade the divine key weapon if you want to upgrade its buffs in the divine key room (with the exception of Creation/Devouring/Sentience since there max levels are 1 and you don't need to upgrade them at all)

### Syncing and Upgrading
To sync a dkey you need to own 2 or more dkeys that are in the same category, I.E have both judgement of shamash and cleaver of shamash to do sync 1 for destruction (if you own utu then its sync 2) it doesn't cost anything to do this. 

Upgrading a dkey can mean 2 things either its the actual weapon level like lvl 50 gtx or the dkey lvl the max of which is 10, tho you get all the passive buffs at lvl 8. Spirit jade, adv skill matz and smelted cores are needed to upgrade dkey lvl in the room, while for the actual weapon its spirit jade, shifters and soulium (lvl 45 if u want to max passive, 50 if u want to get active)

For your upgrade paths do Gtx to 50 -> j.shamash to 50 -> jizo to 50, gtx first as it has the highest atk gain you can get for a single dkey and is the most useful raid weapon since it can be outside of its buffs

## Divine Key Passive and Active buffs
tags: dkey passive

### Acvite buffs
Active buffs are ones when you unlock the gene limit for this dkeys in order to do this simply do either dorm > divine key > gene limit or when you enter abyss or MA look for a flaming sword icon left to the start button

This are the active buffs that are present (this will be assuming max level dkey room):
- Corruption - gain 8% phys dmg or gain 4% crit rate when combo over 30
- Destruction - gain 8% fire dmg or gain 6% tdm in burst mode
- Domination - gain 8% ice dmg or gain 1.6 more sp on basic/charged atks (cooldown of 4s)
- Binding - gain 8% lightning dmg or gain 1.6 more sp on basic/combo atks (cooldown of 4s)

### Passive buffs
Passive buffs are permanently added stats on your valkyries which can be gained when either leveling up the dkey category or when syncing dkeys

The buffs for all the categories are as follow:
- Binding - 15 def, 30 hp and 10 crt; 10 atk instead if sync
- Corruption - 20 hp, 5 atk, 40 def and 5 crt
- Creation - 20 hp; 10 atk if sync
- Destruction - 20 hp, 13 atk and 5 crt; 23 atk instead if sync 1; 33 atk instead if sync 2
- Devouring - 5 atk; 15 atk instead if sync
- Domination - 11 atk and 85 hp; 21 atk instead if sync
- Sentience - 20 hp; 10 atk if sync

**So all in all you can gain 104 atk, 55 def, 195 hp and 20 crt.**

::: warning
Abyss and Fenghuang Pinions are only worth crafting if you own their partners i.e Abyss Flower and FengHuang Down respectively.

## Quick usage guide: Silverwing (SW)
tags: suit sw

- SW Ult is "buff-less". It doesn't matter if or when you use it. (It does set up barrier, but so does Combo.) Thus, ok to skip it during dmg phase and ok to use it halfway into dmg phase.
- Do all your dmg with barrier up. Barrier up on Combo Atk, Ult
- QTE on time-slowed enemies, freeze, other valks' QTEs
- Suggested small rot: AE BBB, Combo, HB QTE, SW QTE, Combo, A spam
- Suggested big rot: AE Ult, HB QTE Ult, SW QTE, Combo, Weapon, A spam, Special Combo, Ult, A spam
- Nex TMB (100%) > Nex TB Peary/Welt (~99%) = Nex MB Linn (99%) > Nex MB Jingwei (94%) > Peary TM Shakes (90%). (Single Nex is worse than Peary TM Shakes.)


## Why you can’t just use one team (or "main") in Honkai
tags: main

Although there are a lot of reasons why you can't do this, the primary two are because of the weather system in Abyss and because of how Memorial Arena functions. 

In Abyss, the weather system is a gameplay mechanic where certain damage types are buffed and debuffed for that abyss cycle (ex: fire damage 50% up, ice damage 50% down). You will need different characters to clear different weathers. 

In Memorial Arena there are multiple bosses, and once you deploy a Valkyrie against a certain boss she can’t be used on a different one until the next week. Hence, you can’t just use one Valkyrie/team in Memorial Arena.

These, combined with other factors like each boss having unique strengths and weaknesses, makes just using one team impossible! You need to shoot for having a variety of unique teams ready to cover different content!

## How EXPA Select and FOCA Select work
tags: expa foca supply select

### EXPA
EXPA Select shares a guarantee counter with the normal Valkyrie Expansion Supply. However, the key difference is that EXPA allows you to choose the uprate Valkyrie from a predetermined pool. These have 3 Valkyries to choose from. Once you select a Valkyrie, you are guaranteed to pull her as the S rank (guaranteed S rank is still at 100 pulls). For example, they may give you the choice between HoS, HFs, and AE, which means you can choose which one of the 3 is the uprate. The uprate Valkyrie selected can be changed up to 5 times. The A ranks available are the same across selections and only S ranks change. Pity resets if you have acquired the S rank Valkyrie. 

### FOCA
FOCA Select contains 5 gear sets you can choose as uprate from a pool. For example, you may be able to choose between HoS’s signature gear, HFs’s signature gear, and so on. You can change what gear you have selected up to 10 times. The sets you do not choose as uprate will still be on the supply as off rates. There is a guarantee only for the uprate weapon at 60 pulls, however, no such guarantees exist for stigmata on this supply. The aforementioned weapon guarantee will reset once you either pull the weapon or change your selected gear. To clarify, this means that if you select one set of gear as uprate, then you change your selection to another set, the pity will reset back to 60. Be mindful of the fact that FOCA Select does not share a guarantee counter with Focused Supply A or Focused Supply B. 

> Note that whichever Valkyries are in the EXPA Select will have their gears in the corresponding FOCA Select. So the gear available on FOCA Select will be the signature sets of the EXPA Select Valkyries along with two other sets MiHoYo chooses to add in.


## Topup Event
You spend x amount of money (yes real money) to b-chips or xtals  (though b -chips is better options than direct xtals but that's for a different day) to get to a milestone, usually this rewards you a box with stamps for 2 S rank valks i.e BK/AE HR/CH, though it can give stamps to awaken and non awakened suits.

these are the possible rewards you can obtain from it:
- 60 crystals/b-chips = special outfit coupon x6 , booster x5
- 300 crystals/b-chips = expansion supply card x1, booster x5
- 600 crystals/b-chips = material option type a x10, booster x10
- 1280 crystals/b-chips = focused supply card x1, AW x50
- 3280 crystals/b-chips = stamps box x1, material option type a x10
- 6480 crystals/b-chips = stamps box x2, material option type a x10

stamps box contain 1 stamp for non-awakening and 2 stamps for awakening;

material option type a lets you choose between phase shifter 1x or sc metal-h2 x3.
(both does not expire so take all the time you need and only use it if you need or know what to get).

> note: it doesn't take into account for first time bonuses, spending topped-up items or topping up outside of the event doesn't count towards it once it shows up it only accounts for what you topped-up during it, any form of top-up can contribute towards the milestones and if you didn't claim the rewards but have reached said milestones it will be delivered to you via mail

## Quick guide: Herrscher of Flamescion (FK)
tags: valk fk

- Herrscher released in 2021 August
- Nice lead skill that gives 50 SP and has on-demand Time Fracture and access to support Pistols, making her useful as a support leader
- Example small dmg rot: AE B B B (B) Combo -> MA Weapon -> FK QTE Combo Weapon A-spam Combo A-spam Combo (A A A) (Ult)
- Example big dmg rot: MA Ult -> AE B Ult -> FK QTE Combo Weapon A-spam Combo A-spam Combo (A A A) Ult
- Ult before AE's Breach runs out
- Does more dmg when HP is low
- Leeuwenhoek TB Thales M a solid pick, only a little worse than Himeko TMB but free and many available strats to copy


## What makes HoS so good?
tags: hos why

1) Despite being primarily a support, she can DPS very well, especially early on.
2) She can consistently give you 50% impair via her spear Combo Attack.
3) She can also give you 75% impair on Ultimate, making her impair one of the strongest in the game. 
4) Strong gather too, and can gather via multiple means which makes her great for mobs in Abyss.
5)HoS has the ability to easily Time Lock, which can proc the QTEs of the majority of DPS.
6) She does not need gacha gear to function as urgently as most modern Valkyires.
7) Her Evasion Skill can be triggered without needing to Ultimate Evade, meaning you don't need the enemy to hit for you to proc Time Fracture QTE's or start Memorial Arena Rotations. However, enemies need to be in hit range of the clone's explosion to trigger the Evasion Skill.
8) The aforementioned Evasion Skill also restores up to 15 SP for all team members.
9) During Ultimate, HoS can trigger stig effects even when off the field.
10) She has a shield that can reduce damage taken, boost ignore interrupt, and give team crit damage.
11) HoS is currently the only support Valkyire capable of using SSwords, a very broken support Stigmata set.

HoS is capable of doing everything listed above at S0 with no gacha gear. Considering most of these things can't even be established by other Valkyires even with their ranks or gear, she's a must-pull for everyone!

## Basics of Team Building
tags: team

In this game, you need a lot of teams! Who you use depends on a lot of things like the game mode, your gear options, the Weather (essentially a system where certain Valkyire/damage types are buffed or debuffed) if you’re fighting in Abyss, and of course what Valkyires you have available!

The normal structure for teams is one damage dealer (DPS) and two supports there to boost your DPS’s  strength. If you run multiple DPS, they’ll just be fighting each other for field time since they don’t do anything when off field. If you run 3 supports, you won’t have anyone for your support’s skills to boost. An easy way to tell if a Valkyire is a support is to read through their skills and see if they have anything that boosts their teammates damage. For example, if a Valkyire has a skill that boosts her teammates ice damage, then she’s most likely an ice support.

Some teams, usually ones which are reliant on things like Time Fracture and fast rotations, are better suited for Memorial Arena while others with slower rotations or less Time Fracture may be better suited for abyss. If you don’t know if a Valkyire/team is more suited for Abyss or Memorial Arena, just ask!

For more details on how to build teams, check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3H0-4c0L9o

**You can also ask questions about what team you should build from scratch, but make sure you include information about what Valkyires you have, how good their gear is, what gamemode you’re in, what you’re trying to fight, and what the Weather is if you’re in Abyss. We can’t help you if you ask for a “general” team since every Valkyire/team covers different things.**


## What is Augmented Battlesuits

Not all battlesuits can be augmented, but some of it can. To unlock this feature you have to be at least 30 on your captain level.

By unlocking this feature, some certain valks will able to obtain new set of skills on their skill tree which allow them to do something different, though some old skills from origin skill tree remains the same as it used to before augmented.

Augmented battesuits are unlocked by obtaining certain amount of Smelted cores and Augment cores itself. Every augmented battlesuits has their own augment cores specifically.

Valk's rank and valk level are also one of the requirement gates. As mentioned on !faq aug below, to unlock higher level of the core you need to reach certain level and ranks aswell.

Unfortunately, Not all augmented battlesuits are good to invest in. Such as VBSF (Fulminata), VD, and DS has small impact to your valk investments, won't give you significant profit aswell. 

However, DK, FT, HF has concrete potential as for the gameplay and being useful a lot on their roles each which makes them a good investment for your account. DK as timefracture, weaken, physical support, while FT as a physical dps but also viable to hold BD on elemental teams, and HF being a decent lightning dps on early levels supported by her kit known as riposte which makes her atks stronger.

## Advantages of playing with keyboard/controller
tags: pc advantages, keyboard advantages, controller

### Keyboard- and controller-only advantages
- can start mashing a button that has not appeared on screen, which results in the button getting registered earlier, e.g. during certain full screen animations, like HS and HT ults, or during pause screen [many example runs]
- certain expensive operations, e.g. on ele shield break, there is a very expensive dmg computation going on, slowing down the game on mobile while not slowing the timer; PC can perform way better [yae kasumi, andrius runs]
- mobile is capped at 60 fps; some frame tight strats are easier at 120 fps [many top end runs]
- on mobile, the location of the switch buttons move! if you switch into valk 1, then valk 2 shifts upwards. this shift costs time! [some fast runs]
- access to common sequences that are impossible or ridiculous on mobile, including but not limited to: tap evade while holding A [HS, FR cancels], tap B to hold A asap [FK cancel], holding B while tapping A [FK, IO, even FT's weapon basic ult], certain pause tech that require the pause button to be pressed quickly or mashed, certain complex sequences that "the faster you press the faster it is", like basic switch cross evade basic switch b combo where you ideally need a finger on every button [rimestar opener]
- slight differences in the distance of boss spawns on mobile make it difficult to copy runs [jizo, parv, among others]
- can straight up mash a lot faster with tactile buttons that have feedback

### Keyboard-only advantages
- you can hold direction "straight up", but the controller/mobile dpad is a continuous circle with no snapping. in some runs, holding straight up is a requirement because you expect the boss to come at you and push you back, but if you're not holding straight up you will not be aligned correctly. [yae kasumi 31680 HT]
- even easier than controller to put a different finger on every button


## Higher requirements
tags: highreq

As the game receives frequent updates, it slowly requires higher system requirements over time.

## Distance in Honkai
tags: distance

- Jin Shengtan blue ring is 5 meters in radius
- Drive Kometa bubble shield is 1 meter in radius


## Some general pull advice
tags: what2pull, what to pull, pull advice

- Save and pull new future valks and their gear, especially on release banners that may have 30-pull guarantee. Try to save for pulling the full set on release; if you're missing one piece sometimes it's like having not pulled at all.
- Support and Divine Keys improve your account in the long term, but damage valks die fast from powercreep.
- It is hard to find any past stuff that is very good to pull. Probably just HS, Cezanne (esp. B), Turg if you didn't get it from BP, Zhenyi, Paganini M. (Not exhaustive and changes over time.) If you're not a big whale you probably will have very little spare resources to patch old stuff.

1. Login on HoYoLAB
2. Check Battle Chronicles and confirm account
3. Login on https://account.hoyoverse.com/ and perform linking of email and password
4. Login in-game

## How to find UID
tags: uid58

Can't login to game in v5.8? Contact CS but forgot your UID?
Tap on `Account Retrieval` and login via your old miHoYo pass, you can find your UID there~


## How to unlink account
tags: unbind, unlink

Because it's linked to a different HYv account than the one you're logging into

CS can help you figure that out

If you use the Account Recovery option in-game and it says that you failed to link because "Honkai Impact 3rd character" is already linked, and you don't remember the HoYoverse login you linked with, or it says the HoYoverse account you're trying to link with is already linked then send an email like this:

```
Subject: Account Retrieval
Body: UID and screenshot of failed to link screen
```

Send the email to one of these emails depending on the server your account is on (please don't send an email to each email or multiple times):


【GLB Server】:
```
honkai3rd_global@hoyoverse.com
```
【SEA server】:
```
honkai3rd_asia@hoyoverse.com
```
【繁中服】：
```
twbh3@pwbplay.com
```

If you don't want to unlink and want to recover your account, don't fill out the form you get sent and just wait for CS.

## Tuning a weapon
tags: tune

You probably always want to Tune a weapon

"Tune" enables the Divine Key benefits for the weapon. It also prevents you from getting rid of the weapon.

Divine Key benefits
- If you did not Tune any Key of Corruption weapon before, turning one of the Key of Corruption weapons will unlock the Key of Corruption effect tree
- Adding a second weapon to a Key may unlock a "Sync" effect which gives all valkyries 10 Atk

Cases where you mayn't want to Tune (but you can pretty much ignore this section)
- You wanna use Might of An-utu to make Sleeper (used to be a potential valid reason)
- You have a duplicate that's a higher level already

## Power creep
tags: powercreep, power creep, old valks, outdated

New valks and equipment are released every ~1.5 months. New valks are progressively stronger, and come with new bosses that have mechanics difficult to overcome with older valks.

Typically, a new valk is good on a few (2 to 4) bosses for 3 months, and then occasionally viable for another 2 to 6 months. Beyond that, it's very rare to find uses for the valk that are not done better by something else.

It is good to do a Google search for how long ago a valk was released to get an idea of its usefulness. If a valk has been out for more than 6 months, resource-constrained players should probably be looking forward to its replacement. Support valks typically last longer.

Herrscher of the Void was released more than 48 months ago; please don't expect grandma to do anything but tickle bosses these days.


## How do you visualize how good an investment is?
tags: power, usefulness, return on investment, roi, payoff

I use "avg. weekly aggregate score increase", and so should you.
It is the sum of score increases across every game mode that matters that I would expect each week, as a consequence of the investment.
(If you like, you can weigh each category based on how much it matters to you, e.g. if you don't care about MA, you can give it 0 weight, i.e. not count it.)

Here's how to use this metric. For this example, I only consider Abyss, because it's easier to explain.
- For a new damage valk, I can expect to use it about once every 2 or 3 cycles, with a 40-point increase over its next best alternative, so in a week that's a 40 point increase total. This decreases sharply over time as Mihoyo promotes other valks.
- For a new Divine Key with global 10 Atk, I expect it to boost my score by ~8 every cycle, so 16 points per week, forever.
- For a new support valk, I expect to use it about once every 2 or 3 cycles, with a 30-point increase over its next best alternative. However, I will continue to use it for longer and in more teams.

::: tip
For Memorial Arena, you can apply similar analysis. Stuff like ELF and global 10 Atk are disproportionately good because they can benefit all 3 bosses each week, every week!

## Daylight saving time issue
tags: dst

mihoyo didn't program for this. your game is probably broken and nothing you do goes through.

a workaround is setting your device time to match the server time shown in game, which you can find on your captain profile. (at least, it should be in a time zone that has crossed the dst boundary.) you can change your device time back after server reset.


## Pri-arms priority
tags: pri priority, pri-arm priority

top priority is usually one of these
- this patch's new pri-arm(s)
- cosmic duality
- purana
- the pri-arm of the stuff you use way more than anything else


## Early/late game
tags: early game, late game

Someone's roughly classification of progression
- Tutorial: until lv 80
- Early game: your first 450 days
- Actual game: after full dorm buffs full divine key so you're finally on the same footing as everyone else
