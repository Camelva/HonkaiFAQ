The categories in bold are true multipliers - they never dilute, only multiply, even with themselves.</p><p>1: Physical Damage Dealt 2: Physical Damage Taken 3: Elemental Damage Dealt 4: Elemental Damage Taken 5: Total Damage Dealt 6: Total Damage Taken 7: Typing Bonus 8: Dirac Weather Typing Bonus 9: Host Specific Physical Taken Debuff 10: Host Specific Elemental Taken Debuff 11: Host Specific Total Taken Debuff</p><p>Any bonuses within a single category add together. Anything from seperate categories multiplies together to give the final result.</p><p>As an small example, assuming no other bonuses, having 20% physical and 20% physical just gives 40% physical as your final result. Having 20% physical and 20% TDM gives you 1.2 * 1.2 = 1.44 = 44% damage increase as final result.</p><p>For true multipliers, they multiply by their stated amount regardless. As an example, Thales M gives 2% host fire taken per stack, up to 10 stacks. Standalone, this is 1.02^10 ~ 1.22, not 1.02*10 = 1.2.</p><h2 id="pity" tabindex="-1">Pity <a class="header-anchor" href="#pity" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>tags: pity, how pity works</p><p>This is how the 10 pull pity counter works. Most supplies have a hidden counter that ranges from 0 to 9. Every time you pull and don&#39;t get a rare outcome, the counter increases. If you do get a rare outcome, it resets to 0. if the counter reaches 9, your next pull is a guaranteed rare outcome.</p><p>For focused, a rare is a 4\u2605 weapon or stig. For expansion, rare is a valkyrie card.</p><p>As a result, x1 and x10 are literally the same thing, but x1 offers you the benefit of being able to stop early if you get what you want before 10 pulls.</p><h2 id="expedition" tabindex="-1">Expedition <a class="header-anchor" href="#expedition" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>tags: expedition</p><p>Expeditions are the primary way of farming most standard A-rank Valkyries. You can find expeditions by going to Attack &gt; Story &gt; Expeditions tab. Completing an expedition stage has a chance of dropping a fragment of the target Valkyrie. Go to Dorm &gt; Expeditions to deploy Valkyries to auto-run expedition stages for you.</p><p>Every Valkyrie has multiple &quot;Acts&quot; (stages) and each Act has either 2 or 3 max attempts per day. The number of max attempts is also the pity counter, i.e. for a 2-attempt Act you&#39;re guaranteed at least one fragment every 2 runs, and for a 3-attempt Act you&#39;re guaranteed at least one fragment every 3 runs. This pity count remains even if you don&#39;t use all attempts in one day.</p><p>Different Acts also cost different amounts of stamina to run so you want to run the more cost-effective Acts first. Since the pity is 2 for some Acts and 3 for others, it&#39;s not as simple as running Acts that cost less stamina. Instead multiply the stamina cost by the number of max attempts to get the stamina cost to guarantee a fragment. Then run the stages that have the lowest cost first.</p><h2 id="fragments" tabindex="-1">Fragments <a class="header-anchor" href="#fragments" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>tags: frag, frags</p><p><strong>To get more Valkyrie Fragments</strong> For suits you don&#39;t own: Menu &gt; Valkyries &gt; tap the one you don&#39;t own &gt; tap Get.

So if valk A is on field and you QTE to valk B, you must wait twice as long before valk A can come back onto the field (4s with no QTE vs 8s with qte).</p><p>That&#39;s why you don&#39;t want to QTE from your damage dealer to a support, and you should generally turn off the QTE skill for the support that comes in right after your damage dealer.</p><h2 id="how-isaac-newton-b-works" tabindex="-1">How Isaac Newton (B) Works <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-isaac-newton-b-works" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>tags: newt, newt B, newton, newton B</p><p>When the holder of Newton B strikes an enemy, it places something called &quot;Challenge Mode&quot; on that enemy for 5 seconds.

This also extends any applicable debuffs on the target by slowing down the counter for them. Newton, Mei, and all of CH&#39;s impair methods are not applicable, for example; they don&#39;t get extended. Stuff like Mjolnir or DP impair does get extended.</p><p>Time Lock temporarily freezes the target in time, immobilizing them completely as well as halting the timer for any applicable debuffs on them. It&#39;s basically a 100% Time Slow.</p><p>Time Fracture slows the entire world, applying time slow to all enemies and also slowing the game clock. This latter effect is incredibly important for Memorial Arena, where scores on bosses are determined by the game clock time.</p><h2 id="crit-damage" tabindex="-1">Crit damage <a class="header-anchor" href="#crit-damage" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>tags: crt, crit</p><p><code>crit rate = CRT / (valk level x 5 + 75) + crit rate buffs</code> For example, a level 80 valkyrie with CRT = 140 has a crit rate of 140 / 475 = 29.5% prior to crit rate buffs.</p><p><code>crit dmg multiplier = 2 + crit dmg buffs</code> For example, Empyrea Phoenix (B) by itself results in crit dmg multiplier = 2.25 for the team after the holder uses a Combo atk.

Some valks, like KMB and GK (HoV), can trigger their Evasion Skill with their evasion action without performing an ultimate evade.</p><p>Ultimate Evasion is using Evasion Action to dodge through an active hitbox. Specifically, the hitbox of the attack must come in contact with the Valkyrie&#39;s hurtbox. This distinction is important, as there are valks whose Evasion Actions can actually dodge hitboxes entirely, such as Roza&#39;s - if she outright avoids the attack by teleporting underneath it, it will not trigger an Ultimate Evasion.</p><p>If the Valkyrie instead puts up a shield, then depending on the mechanism for defending, there are variants of this for those Valkyries. Bronya performs Perfect Defense when you shield an attack then immediately drop the shield after the attack is blocked. BK has a unique Retaliation mechanic in addition to a standard dash-type evasion action.</p><p>Evasion Skill is an ability tied to evasion. For most valks, it activates automatically if it is not on CD and you perform an Ultimate Evasion or Perfect Defense.</p><p>Evadion is built by either performing Retaliation, Perfect Defense, or an Ultimate Evasion - however, Ultimate Evasions can only earn Evadion once per internal evasion cooldown for that character.</p><h2 id="what-to-get-from-an-s-rank-egg" tabindex="-1">What to Get From an S Rank Egg? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-to-get-from-an-s-rank-egg" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>tags: egg</p><p><em><strong>IMPORTANT: Before you choose any Valkyries from the free S rank egg or from Land of Wishes eggs, WAIT until get your first 2 guaranteed S ranks from dorm supply (S ranks guaranteed within 25 pulls).
