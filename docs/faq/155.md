## How do you visualize how good an investment is?
tags: power, usefulness, return on investment, roi, payoff

I use "avg. weekly aggregate score increase", and so should you.
It is the sum of score increases across every game mode that matters that I would expect each week, as a consequence of the investment.
(If you like, you can weigh each category based on how much it matters to you, e.g. if you don't care about MA, you can give it 0 weight, i.e. not count it.)

Here's how to use this metric. For this example, I only consider Abyss, because it's easier to explain.
- For a new damage valk, I can expect to use it about once every 2 or 3 cycles, with a 40-point increase over its next best alternative, so in a week that's a 40 point increase total. This decreases sharply over time as Mihoyo promotes other valks.
- For a new Divine Key with global 10 Atk, I expect it to boost my score by ~8 every cycle, so 16 points per week, forever.
- For a new support valk, I expect to use it about once every 2 or 3 cycles, with a 30-point increase over its next best alternative. However, I will continue to use it for longer and in more teams.

::: tip
For Memorial Arena, you can apply similar analysis. Stuff like ELF and global 10 Atk are disproportionately good because they can benefit all 3 bosses each week, every week!
