tags: spoonfeed

no spoonfeeding, only forkstabbing.

> this is an faq to remind players in help channels to not breakdown every little bit of info for the people asking for help. e.g. "What is HoS?" spoonfeeding would be answering it with "Herrscher of Sentience", you could answer the question, but provide a link to the Abbrevitions page instead.
