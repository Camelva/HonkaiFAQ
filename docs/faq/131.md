## Advantages of playing with keyboard/controller
tags: pc advantages, keyboard advantages, controller

### Keyboard- and controller-only advantages
- can start mashing a button that has not appeared on screen, which results in the button getting registered earlier, e.g. during certain full screen animations, like HS and HT ults, or during pause screen [many example runs]
- certain expensive operations, e.g. on ele shield break, there is a very expensive dmg computation going on, slowing down the game on mobile while not slowing the timer; PC can perform way better [yae kasumi, andrius runs]
- mobile is capped at 60 fps; some frame tight strats are easier at 120 fps [many top end runs]
- on mobile, the location of the switch buttons move! if you switch into valk 1, then valk 2 shifts upwards. this shift costs time! [some fast runs]
- access to common sequences that are impossible or ridiculous on mobile, including but not limited to: tap evade while holding A [HS, FR cancels], tap B to hold A asap [FK cancel], holding B while tapping A [FK, IO, even FT's weapon basic ult], certain pause tech that require the pause button to be pressed quickly or mashed, certain complex sequences that "the faster you press the faster it is", like basic switch cross evade basic switch b combo where you ideally need a finger on every button [rimestar opener]
- slight differences in the distance of boss spawns on mobile make it difficult to copy runs [jizo, parv, among others]
- can straight up mash a lot faster with tactile buttons that have feedback

### Keyboard-only advantages
- you can hold direction "straight up", but the controller/mobile dpad is a continuous circle with no snapping. in some runs, holding straight up is a requirement because you expect the boss to come at you and push you back, but if you're not holding straight up you will not be aligned correctly. [yae kasumi 31680 HT]
- even easier than controller to put a different finger on every button
