# Daylight saving time issue
tags: dst

mihoyo didn't program for this. your game is probably broken and nothing you do goes through.

a workaround is setting your device time to match the server time shown in game, which you can find on your captain profile. (at least, it should be in a time zone that has crossed the dst boundary.) you can change your device time back after server reset.
