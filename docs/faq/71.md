### Weapon Resonance
0. Torus - I recommend most players to wait for Exalted before buying weapons. You need like 50k+ Reson for your PRI-ARMs, and this is the more impactful way to spend your Reson. You may off-rate many of the below weapons.
1. Nebulous Duality
2. Oath of Judah - global +10 Atk
Most players can ignore the following weapons entirely:
3. Blood Dance - strong ele support weapon on SS bosses in MA
4. Thunder Kikaku - lightning support weapon in old SS MA strategies 
5. Swan Lake or Sleeping Beauty - limited use weapon
6. Key of Reason, Mjolnir, Nuada's Grief - very niche or low use weapons

### Stigma Resonance
1. Newton B / Mei: Beach Party M - pick whichever you need the most first. If unsure, pick Newton B. Make sure you get both eventually.
> 1.5. Newton B/ Mei: Beach Party M - get duplicates if you feel theyâ€™re needed for your account
2. Dirac - to expedite farming Elysia
2. Goemon - to expedite farming Handel
3. Schrodinger T - niche strats
3. Schrodinger M - niche SN, BB, SNS strats
