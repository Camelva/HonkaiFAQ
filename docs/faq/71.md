### Weapon Resonance
0. Torus - I recommend most players to wait for Exalted before buying weapons. You need like 50k+ Reson for your PRI-ARMs, and this is the more impactful way to spend your Reson. You may off-rate many of the below weapons.
1. Nebulous Duality
2. Blood Dance - strong ele support weapon on SS bosses in MA
3. Oath of Judah - global +10 Atk
4. Thunder Kikaku - lightning support weapon in MA
5. Swan Lake or Sleeping Beauty - limited use weapon
6. Key of Reason, Mjolnir, Nuada's Grief - very niche or low use weapons
