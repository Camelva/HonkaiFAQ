# What to Get From an S Rank Egg? (Outdated)
tags: egg

***IMPORTANT: Before you choose any Valkyries from the free S rank egg or from Land of Wishes eggs, WAIT until get your first 2 guaranteed S ranks from dorm supply (S ranks guaranteed within 25 pulls). Who you get from dorm supply may affect who you want to choose from the egg.***

### **OVERVIEW:**
There are 3 valkyries that you want to get as soon as possible, KMB, LE, and PX. You have 3 eggs. If necessary, you use the 3 eggs to get those 3 Valkyries. However, if you pull any of those 3 Valkyries from dorm supply, it allows you to choose someone else from the free egg. The next best Valkyrie to get after those 3 is MC.

### **THEREFORE**:
1) If you don’t get any of those 3 valkyries from dorm supply…
    - Free egg: KMB
    - Land of Wishes 1: LE
    - Land of Wishes 2: PX

2) If you get LE and/or KMB from dorm supply…
    - Free egg: MC
    - Land of Wishes 1: LE/KMB (whichever you don’t have, LE dupe if you have both)
    - Land of Wishes 2: PX

3) If you get PX but not LE or KMB from dorm supply
    - Free egg: KMB
    - Land of Wishes 1: LE
    - Land of Wishes 2: (See Note)

4) If you can manage to get KMB, LE, PX, and MC without having to use the free egg, then choose SK from the free egg.

**NOTE:**
If in any scenario, you get PX from dorm supply, hold off on doing second Land of Wishes.
