# Pity
tags: pity, how pity works

### This is how the 10 pull pity counter works:
Most supplies have a hidden counter that ranges from 0 to 9. Every time you pull and don't get a rare outcome, the counter increases. If you do get a rare outcome, it resets to 0. if the counter reaches 9, your next pull is a guaranteed rare outcome.

- For focused, a rare is a 4â˜… weapon or stig.
- For expansion, rare is a valkyrie card.

As a result, x1 and x10 are literally the same thing, but x1 offers you the benefit of being able to stop early if you get what you want before 10 pulls.
