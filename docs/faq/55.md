# How outfit bingo works
tags: bingo

A board containing the outfit may appear after you obtain the top prize on at least 3 boards. A board containing the top prize must appear after obtaining the top prize on at least 5 boards.

The expected number of tile flips to obtain the top prize is 12.9 flips. Each tile flip is an independent event. The likelihood of any tile flip yielding the top prize is 3%. There is a 63.3% chance that all 16 tiles must be flipped. This expected number of flips is calculated as `sum(xP(x),1<=x<=16)`, where `P(x)=0.97^(x-1)*0.03` and `P(16)=0.633=1-sum(P(x),1<=x<=15)`.

*If there is a secret soft pity, it is not known and has not been considered here.*
