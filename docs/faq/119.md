## What is Augmented Battlesuits

Not all battlesuits can be augmented, but some of it can. To unlock this feature you have to be at least 30 on your captain level.

By unlocking this feature, some certain valks will able to obtain new set of skills on their skill tree which allow them to do something different, though some old skills from origin skill tree remains the same as it used to before augmented.

Augmented battesuits are unlocked by obtaining certain amount of Smelted cores and Augment cores itself. Every augmented battlesuits has their own augment cores specifically.

Valk's rank and valk level are also one of the requirement gates. As mentioned on !faq aug below, to unlock higher level of the core you need to reach certain level and ranks aswell.

Unfortunately, Not all augmented battlesuits are good to invest in. Such as VBSF (Fulminata), VD, and DS has small impact to your valk investments, won't give you significant profit aswell. 

However, DK, FT, HF has concrete potential as for the gameplay and being useful a lot on their roles each which makes them a good investment for your account. DK as timefracture, weaken, physical support, while FT as a physical dps but also viable to hold BD on elemental teams, and HF being a decent lightning dps on early levels supported by her kit known as riposte which makes her atks stronger.
