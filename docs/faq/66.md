Quick expedition farming guide

1. Pity counter of N where N is the number of allowed daily attempts, i.e. you are guaranteed the Frag in N or fewer completions.
2. As is usual for pity, the counter resets on a drop of the Frag. However, the counter does not reset at daily server reset.
3. Very low, seemingly fixed chance of Frag drop on non-pity completion.

Thus,
1. Prefer expedition with the lowest stamina cost for pity, i.e. the lowest N x S where S is the stamina per attempt.
2. If two expeditions have the same N x S, prefer the one with the greater N.
3. It is best to use all allowed daily attempts even if you get the Frag before the Nth completion, unless of course you have already finished your farming goal.
