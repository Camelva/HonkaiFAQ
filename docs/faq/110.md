# Quick usage guide: Silverwing (SW)
tags: suit sw

- SW Ult is "buff-less". It doesn't matter if or when you use it. (It does set up barrier, but so does Combo.) Thus, ok to skip it during dmg phase and ok to use it halfway into dmg phase.
- Do all your dmg with barrier up. Barrier up on Combo Atk, Ult
- QTE on time-slowed enemies, freeze, other valks' QTEs
- Suggested small rot: AE BBB, Combo, HB QTE, SW QTE, Combo, A spam
- Suggested big rot: AE Ult, HB QTE Ult, SW QTE, Combo, Weapon, A spam, Special Combo, Ult, A spam
- Nex TMB (100%) > Nex TB Peary/Welt (~99%) = Nex MB Linn (99%) > Nex MB Jingwei (94%) > Peary TM Shakes (90%). (Single Nex is worse than Peary TM Shakes.)
