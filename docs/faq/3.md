# Damage Types
tags: damage, damage types

There are 11 multiplier categories, though most valkyries don't use all of them at the same time, and some of these don't actually exist yet. The categories in bold are true multipliers - they never dilute, only multiply, even with themselves.

1. Physical Damage Dealt
2. Physical Damage Taken
3. Elemental Damage Dealt
4. Elemental Damage Taken
5. Total Damage Dealt
6. Total Damage Taken
7. Typing Bonus
8. Dirac Weather Typing Bonus
9. **Host Specific Physical Taken Debuff**
10. **Host Specific Elemental Taken Debuff**
11. **Host Specific Total Taken Debuff**

Any bonuses within a single category add together. Anything from seperate categories multiplies together to give the final result.

As an small example, assuming no other bonuses, having $20\%$ physical and $20\%$ physical just gives $40\%$ physical as your final result. Having $20\%$ physical and $20\%$ TDM gives you $1.2 \times 1.2 = 1.44 = 44\%$ damage increase as final result.

For true multipliers, they multiply by their stated amount regardless. As an example, Thales M gives $2\%$ host fire taken per stack, up to 10 stacks. Standalone, this is $1.02^{10} \approx 1.22$, not $1.02 \times 10 = 1.2$.
