## Reroll
tags: reroll

You spend ~2 hours for a roughly 11k-Crystal head start, i.e. ~1 month worth of F2P Crystal income.

During rare events the game gives 5 cards to players unconditionally. This is a great time to reroll! It takes less time and you only spend half of your beginner Crystals.

How to reroll:
- Each run is about 15-20 minutes. Pull on the target banner while earning Crystals.
- Video how-to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISOt7CiOWpE

Choosing target supply:
1. Ideally, Expansion Supply for Herrscher Senti
2. Expansion Supply for another recent S-rank might be good; better ask if it's good
3. Starter Supply, but if you're aiming for Herrscher Senti it could take longer
