### **IS HOV WORTH INVESTING IN?**

*No, she's not worth investing in anymore.*

She simply doesn't have a place in the meta anywhere anymore, even at SSS rank. The main reason for that is **not** as many people assume Elysia, they are completely different and cannot be compared in most cases, but instead Silverwing. The one place where HoV was meta up until Silverwing's release was Ranged weather Assaka boss in Superstring Dimension (EX Abyss), but due to temperatures being extremely high nowadays, Assaka's shield in that stage has become a big problem especially when we take into consideration the very tiny delay that shield has until it completely regenerates, therefore you're better off using Silverwing to completely bypass the shield, thanks to her elemental damage.
