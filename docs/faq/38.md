# Attack types (outdated)
tags: attack types

Gauntlet/Dual guns/Katana users can use combo attacks.

Greatsword/Heavy weapon/Cross/Scythe/Lance/Bow users can use charged attacks.

The only exceptions are: GK, SA, IO, and SNS, whom have the opposite of the norm for their weapon type.

If a valkyrie can perform combo attacks, then they cannot perform charged attacks and the reverse is also true.

Note that using charged attacks will not satisfy "kill an enemy with combo attacks" and the reverse is also true; combo attacks will not satisfy "kill an enemy with charged attacks."

> notes for updating: generalize more, probably explain how to check in-game instead of just assuming based on weapon.
