tags: expedition

Expeditions are the primary way of farming most standard A-rank Valkyries. You can find expeditions by going to Attack > Story > Expeditions tab. Completing an expedition stage has a chance of dropping a fragment of the target Valkyrie. Go to Dorm > Expeditions to deploy Valkyries to auto-run expedition stages for you. 

Every Valkyrie has multiple "Acts" (stages) and each Act has either 2 or 3 max attempts per day. The number of max attempts is also the pity counter, i.e. for a 2-attempt Act you're guaranteed at least one fragment every 2 runs, and for a 3-attempt Act you're guaranteed at least one fragment every 3 runs. This pity count remains even if you don't use all attempts in one day. 

Different Acts also cost different amounts of stamina to run so you want to run the more cost-effective Acts first. Since the pity is 2 for some Acts and 3 for others, it's not as simple as running Acts that cost less stamina. Instead multiply the stamina cost by the number of max attempts to get the stamina cost to guarantee a fragment. Then run the stages that have the lowest cost first.
