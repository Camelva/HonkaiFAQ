# ELI5: How does X affect my damage?
tags: dmg, eli5damage, eli5dmg

**In general, damage is the product of several factors**

**In general, when we equip something we add a number to one of the factors**

For example, damage done to an enemy who is in Challenge mode (Newton B's effect) is calculated with 0.31 added to the `Total Dmg Taken` factor.

Main factors to be concerned about:
Damage = `some mysterious starting number`
- × `Ele Dmg Dealt` IF Ele
- × `Ele Dmg Taken` IF Ele
- × `Phys Dmg Dealt` IF Phys
- × `Phys Dmg Taken` IF Phys
- × `Crit Dmg` IF Phys AND Crit
- × `Total Dmg Dealt`
- × `Total Dmg Taken`
- × `Weather Effect`
- × `Type Effect`
- × `Ele Resist Effect` IF Ele
- × `Phys Resist Effect` IF Phys

Other than these, there are also some unique factors, often described in game as "independent effect"

Each factor is 1 when valk, gear, stage effects are not included, except `Crit Dmg`, which starts at 2

`Weather Effect` is often 1.5 for advantageous type. However, some Abyss Weathers increase a different factor like `Total Dmg Dealt` instead of `Weather Effect`.

`Type Effect` is 1.3 for type advantage and either 0.7 or 1/1.3 for type disadvantage

`some mysterious starting number is usually` a statement like this,
>"deals 2400% of Atk as Fire Dmg"

which means that you take the valk's Atk × 24 as the starting number.

`Ele Resist Effect` is just a number less than or equal to 1
based on the enemy's Ele Resist,

e.g. `Ele Resist Effect` = 0.28 for Jizo, who has 72% Ele Resist.

`Phys Resist Effect` = `1 / (1 + (Def / (300 + 20 * Lv)))`, 
where Def is the enemy's Def and Lv is your valk's Lv.
