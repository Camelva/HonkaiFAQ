# Dorm Supply

**It is not recommended to pull on Dorm Supply using crystals.**

Each Dorm Supply pull costs 200 crystals but only gives an expected ~60 crystals worth of value in terms of S-rank valkyries. (Fewer if you already own some of the S-rank valkyries.)

Instead, it is recommended that you use only freely obtained Dorm Supply Cards on Dorm Supply.
