# Why you can’t just use one team (or "main") in Honkai
tags: main

Although there are a lot of reasons why you can't do this, the primary two are because of the weather system in Abyss and because of how Memorial Arena functions. 

In Abyss, the weather system is a gameplay mechanic where certain damage types are buffed and debuffed for that abyss cycle (ex: fire damage 50% up, ice damage 50% down). You will need different characters to clear different weathers. 

In Memorial Arena there are multiple bosses, and once you deploy a Valkyrie against a certain boss she can’t be used on a different one until the next week. Hence, you can’t just use one Valkyrie/team in Memorial Arena.

These, combined with other factors like each boss having unique strengths and weaknesses, makes just using one team impossible! You need to shoot for having a variety of unique teams ready to cover different content!
