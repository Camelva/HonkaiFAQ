```
Calculations:
500 x 6 = 3000 (Elysian Realm) [For newer players, this will be lower]
Abyss x 12 = Total Abyss
Memorial Arena Attempts x 6 = Total MA
Daily Duty = 40 * 42 = 1680
Daily Signin = 42/30 x 400 = 560
Daily Hoyolab = 42/30 * 50 = 70
Survey = 200
Maintenance = 600
Stream + Additional Codes: 200 (livestream) + 60 * 2 (additional stream) + 30 + 60 + 80 (usually 3 more codes, containing each respectively per patch) = 490
Armada: 25 x 6 = 150
F2P BP: 540
Paid (Knight/Pally) BP: 1260
Monthly Card: 4382
6550 + BP (F2P/Paid) + Total Abyss + Total MA + Monthly Card
```

Note:
This does not include other one-time sources of crystals, events, or RNG elements such as adventure tasks and dorm errands. Overall income will be higher.
