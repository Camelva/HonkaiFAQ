Elemental damage has no direct interations with other elements. Some content may have elements which have an advantage, or an elemental status condition. 

EX: Cryo enemies don't usually take extra Pyro damage.

Elemental Damage cannot Critically hit, but it by-passes Shields(yellow) and the DEF stat. Make sure to read stage descriptions for advantaged types.
