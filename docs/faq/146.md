# What is a Stigmata?

Stigmata are gear pieces that can be equipped on Valkyries. Each Valkyrie has three Stigmata slots: T, M, and B. Similarly, there are T, M, and B Stigmata. Stigmata can only be placed in their corresponding slot on a Valkyrie. T Stigmata can only be placed in a Valkyrie's T slot, and so on.

Stigmata can provide a variety of effects and are essential to building Valkyries. They can boost either damage dealt by the host or the team depending on the effects, and also provide both individual and set bonuses!

Don't hesitate to ask what kind of Stigmata a Valkyrie can use!
