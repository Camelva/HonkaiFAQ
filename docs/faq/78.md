Imy's advice for salvaging materials for Asterite
- Phase Shifters: don't salvage until 300 days played, then retain at least 300
- Fluid Alloy Block: don't salvage until 300 days played, then retain at least 150
- Adv Skill Mats: retain at least 250
- AE Imaginon: retain at least 1500, including Honkai Shards which count as 50 each
- SS Imaginon: retain at least 380 for emergencies
- Always salvage with energy
- Above is a little generous and you may wish to salvage a little more aggressively
