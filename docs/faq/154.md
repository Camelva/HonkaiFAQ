New valks and equipment are released every ~1.5 months. New valks are progressively stronger, and come with new bosses that have mechanics difficult to overcome with older valks.

Typically, a new valk is good on a few (2 to 4) bosses for 3 months, and then occasionally viable for another 2 to 6 months. Beyond that, it's very rare to find uses for the valk that are not done better by something else.

It is good to do a Google search for how long ago a valk was released to get an idea of its usefulness. If a valk has been out for more than 6 months, resource-constrained players should probably be looking forward to its replacement. Support valks typically last longer.

Herrscher of the Void was released more than 48 months ago; please don't expect grandma to do anything but tickle bosses these days.
