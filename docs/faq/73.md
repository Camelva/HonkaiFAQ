# What makes DK so good?
tags: dk why


1) Uncharged bolt makes enemies take 50% more shield damage
2) Very long time fracture on block
3) Each block also restores 6 sp for the whole team
4) Uncharged bolt weakens, great for QTE triggers (e.g. FT, SN) and passives (e.g. FT buffed against weakened enemies)
5) Whole team's melee attacks gain 25% physical damage and 10% crit rate as long as shield is active
6) Did I mention she has a shield? Some added QoL and also can make it more consistent to maintain Lier B buff
7) QTE and ULT gathers enemies which can be useful for abyss mobbing teams
8) Can hold Briareus EX. This weapon provides impair and also keeps DK on field which lets her consistently reapply Newton B and Picasso debuff effects.
9) Nice lead skill too
