::: tip
Make sure you get 2 Dorm guarantees before buying cards from WT, or opening S-rank egg
:::

### Ancient Willpower valks
- Check ["!faq dorm buff"](/faq/107) for a guide on the order in which you should get AW valks
- None of the valks are very good to invest in for use in battle
- MC and BN are the most useful since they increase total damage dealt
- Decreasing damage taken by a valk is the most useless dorm buff. Donâ€™t buy those
- After that, get all of the valks with useful buffs to SS to further increase the power of their dorm buff.

### Ancient Legacy valks
- Unlike AW, AL is hard to get, especially if you're below level 81
- JK is the number one priority. She replaces HB as an ice support, and at SS0 rank or full gear does shieldbreak for ice teams as well as well (good against Huodou)
- Because FR and MPE are old, they need high ranks to function. Older players will already have them at SSS
- FR needs her weapon to function. While she can be used at S0 for quantum collapse support she needs to be at least S1 to function as a support and even then misses out on the significant buffs she gets at high ranks. 
- MPE also needs her weapon and needs to be SS0 minimum to function. She is good for a variety of weathers, including shield and ranged weather
- More info on MPE and FR here: https://discord.com/channels/418652140454674432/901268521181401108/927433678387286036

### Income and farming speed
- Check ["!faq ancient"](/faq/102) for details
- In 1 year of play, it is possible to get two SSS-rank Ancient Willpower valks and more

### S-rank egg
- Ideally, save this egg until you have only 1 valk that you do not have
- If you're a little more impatient, you can open it as soon as you finished your 2 Dorm guarantees, and pick a valk you do not own according to your farming priority
- Picking an unowned valk roughly saves you 5 weeks of Ancient Willpower income
