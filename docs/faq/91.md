Most gacha valks need most of their gacha signature equipment by virtue of not being much better or at all better than farmable valks when both use farmable gear.

When you pull a gacha valk without gearing her appropriately, you haven't gained any edge over players who are using only farmable valks!

Don't hesitate to ask for what kind of setups a valk can use!
