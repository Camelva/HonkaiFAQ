# Evasion
tags: evasion

Evasion Action is pressing the button. Some valks, like KMB and GK (HoV), can trigger their Evasion Skill with their evasion action without performing an ultimate evade.

Ultimate Evasion is using Evasion Action to dodge through an active hitbox. Specifically, the hitbox of the attack must come in contact with the Valkyrie's hurtbox. This distinction is important, as there are valks whose Evasion Actions can actually dodge hitboxes entirely, such as Roza's - if she outright avoids the attack by teleporting underneath it, it will not trigger an Ultimate Evasion.

If the Valkyrie instead puts up a shield, then depending on the mechanism for defending, there are variants of this for those Valkyries. Bronya performs Perfect Defense when you shield an attack then immediately drop the shield after the attack is blocked. BK has a unique Retaliation mechanic in addition to a standard dash-type evasion action.

Evasion Skill is an ability tied to evasion. For most valks, it activates automatically if it is not on CD and you perform an Ultimate Evasion or Perfect Defense.

Evadion is built by either performing Retaliation, Perfect Defense, or an Ultimate Evasion - however, Ultimate Evasions can only earn Evadion once per internal evasion cooldown for that character.
