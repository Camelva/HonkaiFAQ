## Tuning a weapon
tags: tune

You probably always want to Tune a weapon

"Tune" enables the Divine Key benefits for the weapon. It also prevents you from getting rid of the weapon.

Divine Key benefits
- If you did not Tune any Key of Corruption weapon before, turning one of the Key of Corruption weapons will unlock the Key of Corruption effect tree
- Adding a second weapon to a Key may unlock a "Sync" effect which gives all valkyries 10 Atk

Cases where you mayn't want to Tune (but you can pretty much ignore this section)
- You wanna use Might of An-utu to make Sleeper (used to be a potential valid reason)
- You have a duplicate that's a higher level already
