# Tuning a weapon
tags: tune

You probably always want to Tune a weapon

Tune enables the Divine Key benefits for the weapon. It also prevents you from getting rid of the weapon.

Divine Key benefits
- If you did not Tune any Key of Corruption weapon before, turning one of the Key of Corruption weapons will unlock the Key of Corruption effect tree
- Adding a second weapon to a Key may unlock a "Sync" effect which gives all valks 10 Atk

You can still use the Tuned weapon to forge its own PRI-ARM, e.g. use Pledge of Sakura to make Salvation of Sakura. In fact you must Tune a Divine Key to use it to make its PRI-ARM.

Rare cases where you mayn't want to Tune, but you can pretty much ignore this section
- You wanna use Might of An-utu to make Sleeper (used to be a potential valid reason)
- You have a duplicate that's a higher level already
