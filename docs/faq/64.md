# Worthwhile Crystallum/Lucion targets(outdated)
tags: fallen crystallum

Roughly in priority order, but may vary somewhat based on your account

- Jin Shengtan TM (8)
- Key of Reason (12)
- Sirin Ascendant T (8)
- Kafka TM (8 each) if you don't have other options for FT
- Iris of the Dreams (12)
- Path to Acheron (12) and Allan Poe TMB (10 each) if you own SN, but pull/off-rate some pieces first
- Sirin Ascendant M (8)
- 2nd Jin Shengtan TM (8 each)
- Hekate's Gloom (12)
- Sirin Ascendant B (8)

Starting from 5.0, AE and SN and their rank-up items will be added to BP using new Crystallum. Those are higher priority than gear. You will not be able to convert old Crystallum to new.
