### How to make your Hoyolab Battle Chronicles public
Step by step guide:
####  **Step 1**. 
Make sure your Hoyolab is tied to your Honkai account and you have enabled "Privacy Settings > Show your Character Details in the Battle Chronicle"
#### **Step 2**. 
Find your Hoyolab user ID, such as by going to your personal page and looking for "Account ID:" or by inspecting its URL, e.g. https://www.hoyolab.com/accountCenter/postList?id=11446044
#### **Step 3**. 
Replace the user ID in the following link with your user ID: https://act.hoyolab.com/app/community-game-records-sea/index.html?user_id=11446044#/bh3
#### **Step 4**. 
Paste the result in chat, or I guess you can just post your user ID and someone else will figure it out lol
