## In-game gacha rates
tags: rates

These are the rates presented in the in-game announcements.

The in-game rates are inclusive of pity. This is to say that the rate on non-pity pulls are much lower, e.g. we think Expansion Supply S card is 0.6% on a non-pity pull.

Based on research, we think there is soft pity that increases the drop rate above 80 pulls, and this is not counted in the in-game rates.
