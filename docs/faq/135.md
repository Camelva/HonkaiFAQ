# Some general pull advice
tags: what2pull, what to pull, pull advice

- Save and pull future new valks and their gear, especially on release banners that may have 30-pull guarantee. Try to save up so you can pull the full set on release; if you're missing one piece sometimes it's like having not pulled at all.
- Support and Divine Keys improve your account in the long term, but damage valks die fast from powercreep.
- It is hard to find any past stuff that is very good to pull. Probably just Cezanne, Zhenyi, Paganini M. (This list is not exhaustive and will change over time.) If you're not a big whale you probably will have very little spare resources to get old stuff.
