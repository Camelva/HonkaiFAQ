## Some general pull advice
tags: what2pull, what to pull, pull advice

- Save and pull new future valks and their gear, especially on release banners that may have 30-pull guarantee. Try to save for pulling the full set on release; if you're missing one piece sometimes it's like having not pulled at all.
- Support and Divine Keys improve your account in the long term, but damage valks die fast from powercreep.
- It is hard to find any past stuff that is very good to pull. Probably just HS, Cezanne (esp. B), Turg if you didn't get it from BP, Zhenyi, Paganini M. (Not exhaustive and changes over time.) If you're not a big whale you probably will have very little spare resources to patch old stuff.
