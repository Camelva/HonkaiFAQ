Understanding Elemental Breach ("元素穿透")
1. Enemies have ele resist. Most Ex MA bosses have 31%. Jizo has 72%. 31% resist means 0.69 is multiplied to any dmg.
2. Ele Breach is reduction in ele resist, i.e. the number is directly subtracted from ele resist. AE has 14% Ele Breach, so bosses with 31% ele resist have 17% ele resist after 14% Ele Breach.
3. To illustrate the impact of Ele Breach, 31% ele resist with 14% Ele Breach results in 83 / 69 = 1.203 times more damage. 72% ele resist with 14% Ele Breach results in 42 / 28 = 1.5 times more damage. In summary, damage increase as a result of having Ele Breach is Ele Breach / (1 - ele resist)
4. Each source of Ele Breach is subtracted from ele resist. For example, 14% from AE Ult and 20% from HR Ult (total 34%) results in Jizo having 38% ele resist and bosses with 31% ele resist having 0 ele resist. Note that ele resist cannot be negative, so Ele Breach is no longer useful once ele resist has been reduced to 0.

Understanding Physical Breach ("物理穿透")
1. Physical Breach is, at the time of writing, a concept only available in Elysian Realm.
2. Physical Breach does not behave like Ele Breach. Based on testing, it is the same as Impair. See "!faq impair".
3. My best guess for why Physical Breach exists in addition to Impair is that historically Impair has been single instance instead of stacking, so they introduced a different name to show this difference.
