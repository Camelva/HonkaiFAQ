# Crit damage
tags: crt, crit

$$Crit Rate = \frac{CRT}{(Valk Level \times 5 + 75)} + Crit Rate Buffs$$
For example, a level 80 valkyrie with $CRT = 140$ has a crit rate of $140 / 475 = 29.5\%$ prior to crit rate buffs.

$$Crit Dmg Multiplier = 2 + Crit Dmg Buffs$$
For example, Empyrea Phoenix (B) by itself results in $Crit Dmg Multiplier = 2.25$ for the team after the holder uses a Combo atk. This means that critical hits do $2.25$ times the damage of non-critical hits.
