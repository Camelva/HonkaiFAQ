# Crit damage
tags: crt, crit

`crit rate = CRT / (valk level x 5 + 75) + crit rate buffs`
For example, a level 80 valkyrie with CRT = 140 has a crit rate of 140 / 475 = 29.5% prior to crit rate buffs.

`crit dmg multiplier = 2 + crit dmg buffs`
For example, Empyrea Phoenix (B) by itself results in crit dmg multiplier = 2.25 for the team after the holder uses a Combo atk. This means that critical hits do 2.25 times the damage of non-critical hits.
