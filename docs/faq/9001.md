# Valkyrie battlesuit fragments and ranking them up

There are several ways to obtain fragments: buying from [shop](/faq/35), farming [expeditions](/faq/5), getting for free from events, or obtaining [duplicate battlesuit card](#duplicate-battlesuit-card). 

Every battlesuit has a "Get" button, which displays how to obtain fragments for that battlesuit. If there's nothing - then it's either gacha or limited

:::tip Note
Technically, awakened valkyries use *souls* insteas of fragments, but for simplicity of this guide we're gonna call them fragments as well.
:::

When you gathered enough fragments of certain valk - you can unlock her if still don't own, or - further upgrade her rank for more stats and additional skills

## Stamps
Basically, stamps are just 10 packed up fragments of certain battlesuit. The only detail to keep in mind is - you can use stamps **only if you already have that battlesuit unlocked**. 

:::details Example

## Ranking up
To increase rank (rank up), you need to collect certain amount of fragments, which varies based on the "class" of battlesuit - normal, awakened or SP. 

::: info Q: "What's awakened battlesuit?"
A: To learn more about them and main differences you can read this [faq awakened](/faq/41)

<!-- TODO: same block with faq sp  -->

Fragment requirements are as such:

| To get rank | Battlesuit Type|||
| ^^ | Normal | Awakened | SP |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Unlock A rank | 30 | 40 | 40 |
| Unlock S rank | 80 | 100 | - |
| B --> A | 20 | - | - |
| A --> S | 50 | 60 | 60 |
| S --> SS | 100 | 250 | 200 |
| SS --> SSS | 200 | 600 | 400 |

## Sub-ranks
All valks have additional breakpoints when ranking them up. In other words - sub-ranks. 

For old valks it were stars, but for new devs introduced so-called "constellations".

Main difference between them:
- old valks with stars: sub-ranks grant more stats, but for skills need to reach next rank
    ::: details Example of old system
    ![old system](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/863682609979981874/1051452527079604295/IMG_20221211_125619.jpg)
    > Notice how you unlock a skill only after reaching SSS rank
    :::
- constellations: besides of stats sub-ranks also grant skill upgrades/new skills
    ::: details Example of new system

| To get rank | Stars || Constellations || SP |
| ^^ | Normal | Awakened | Normal | Awakened | ^^ |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| S1 | 30 | 70 | 25 | 60 | 60 |
| S2 | 30 | 70 | 25 | 60 | 60 |
| S3 | - | - | 25 | 60 | - |
| SS | 40 | 110 | 25 | 70 | 80 |
| **Total for S --> SS** | **100** | **250** | **100** | **250** | **200** |
| SS1 | 50 | 150 | 50 | 150 | 100 |
| SS2 | 50 | 150 | 50 | 150 | 100 |
| SS3 | 50 | 150 | 50 | 150 | 100 |
| SSS | 50 | 150 | 50 | 150 | 100 |
| **Total for SS --> SSS** | **200** | **600** | **200** | **600** | **400** |

So in the end, total amount is same. The only difference is in how that amount is distributed among sub-ranks

## Duplicate battlesuit card
When you obtain card for a battlesuit you already have unlocked - it will be transformed to fragments of that suit. Amount of those fragments also depends on suit's base rank and class

| Battlesuit class | Base rank |||
| ^^ | B | A | S |
| :---: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Normal | 7 | 18 | 30 |
| Awakened | - | 30 | 70 |
| SP | - | 30 | - |
[Fragments for duplicate card]
