# What to buy in shops

[[toc]]

## Daily Shop
### Logistics Terminal
0. Nothing with crystals price
1. Everything with coins price (keep buying valk/elf fragments even after maxing them, for [Witch orbs](#witchs-corridor))
2. 1800 asterite mind stones

### Exchange Shop

#### Weapon Resonance
0. Torus - I recommend most players to wait for Exalted before buying weapons. You need like 50k+ Reson for your PRI-ARMs, and this is the more impactful way to spend your Reson. You may off-rate many of the below weapons.
1. Nebulous Duality
2. Blood Dance - strong ele support weapon on SS bosses in MA
3. Oath of Judah - global +10 Atk (more about [what is Divine Key](/faq/108) and [buffs](/faq/109))
4. Very niche or rarely used weapons, most people won't need them:
    1. Thunder Kikaku - lightning support weapon in MA
    2. Swan Lake or Sleeping Beauty - limited use weapon
    3. Key of Reason, Mjolnir, Nuada's Grief - very niche or low use weapons

#### Stigma Resonance
1. Newton B
2. Newton B
3. Mei: Beach Party M
4. Newton B
5. Mei: Beach Party M
6. Newton B
7. Mei: Beach Party M
8. Very niche gear for specific strats:
    1. Schrodinger T - niche strats
    2. Schrodinger M - niche SN, BB strats
    3. Otto Apocalypse M - outdated FT strats

### Dorm Shop
1. Battle Pass Crystallum (orb), 2 x 1600
2. All torus, 50 x 100
3. Phase shifters, as many as possible
4. Can buy dorm supply cards if lacking some for spending event (need 20). But its *possible* to get enough even without buying them here

### Witch's Corridor
Learn more about Witch Orbs here - [faq witch orb](/faq/106)

1. Normal crystal cores with regular witch orbs

Pure witch orb should be discussed together with [Ancient Willpower](#war-treasury) priority

### Supply Shop
1. Normal crystal cores is an overwhelmingly good deal

<!-- no idea what it means so I just comment it out for now 

i can see a weak case for some stamps or elf frags but it's gotta be super compelling 
-->

## Activity Shop
### Elysian Shop
1. Weekly phase shifters
2. Patch valk fragments, even if maxed, for NCC
3. Weekly time swirl, spatial lens if desperately needed
4. Stamps after all of that

### War Treasury
[Discussed in dedicated article](/faq/1)

### Co-op Shop
1. Patch honkai shards
2. Buy out all spirit jade
3. After upgrading your divine keys:
    1. Buy out mind stones
    2. Buy out phase shifters

### Mirage Store

2. Time swirl for time structures only after you need not reset soulium raid

- Time swirl for ranger creds too expensive
- Reroll devices might be an option if you have nothing else to craft
