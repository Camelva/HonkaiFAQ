## How good is X, I saw it in [spoilers]
tags: beta

What you just saw was something from the Beta Server! 

**Beta versions usually undergo meta-significant and fundamental changes to the unit/weapon/gear before it reaches live. It is completely pointless to speculate the strength of something which is still in Beta.**

Furthermore, the true strength of a unit can only be revealed once the dalaos (pros) have gotten them on the live version, and they get to play around with it. Sometimes the beta-testers miss meta things!

Some examples:
- AF numbers were tossed around throughout all 3 Beta patches!
- HT Dragon mode couldn't be exited voluntarily during Beta V1!
- Almost all MA/Abyss rots arn't developed until it hits live! Who knew HS could fight rimestar?
