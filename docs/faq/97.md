## PRI leveling
tags: pri leveling

maxing a few pri-arms
- lets you copy runs (you also need good affixes)
- lets you possibly score high on a few bosses
- easier time playing the game, but lower score

level more pri-arms evenly
- won't be able to copy strats because nobody makes them for your specific pri-arm level
- lets you score evenly across all bosses
- takes time, effort and brain to figure out your own runs for those high scores

my overall recommendation is the former. you can have an easier time playing the game, get used to copying strats (what top players do) instead of inventing new strats every week and then discarding them soon after. you may even score overall higher if you have less time to play the game.
