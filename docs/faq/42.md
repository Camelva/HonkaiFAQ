# Branch attack (combo, charged)
tags: combo attack, charged attack, branch attack

Each valk has either "Combo Atk" or "Charged Atk", never both
Whether a valk uses Combo or Charged is explicitly written in the valk's skill tree

Combo (分支 i.e. "Branch") Atk users:
- Fist, Pistols, Blade wielders and SA, IO, SW

Charged (蓄力) Atk users:
- Greatsword, Heavy (cannon), Cross, Scythe, Lance, Bow wielders and GK, Carole

Extra notes:
- Using Charged Atk will not satisfy "Kill an enemy with Combo Atks" and vice versa.
- Combo Atk is an independent concept from the Combo Hit Count (top left corner counter).
