# Genshin event (collab/crossover)

### Keqing???

She's an event character, not obtainable from gacha or through farming. She won't be playable anymore once the event ends.

### Genshin collab???

This is a crossover, not a collab, meaning that the characters and items (except for Keqing) will remain in your inventory, ready to be used, and will remain obtainable again from gacha or through farming.

### Fischl gear and role???

Mainly a lightning support, deals moderate damage, not good enough to be a DPS in meta teams though.
Her signature gear is obtainable from gacha, the banner opens at 12:00 PM server-time on July 9th.
