# Desirable affixes (outdated)
tags: affix

1. Gain Atk. Unless otherwise specified, just aim for all Atk affix lines on your dmg valks.
2. Gain Crit Dmg. This is usually comparably valuable to gain Atk, in some cases better, but only Phys can Crit. Because affix mats are expensive, would take this along with gain Atk on Phys valks.
3. SP regen near enemies. In rare cases useful on dmg valks for some SP-tight runs. Generally useful on support valks.
4. Attacks do X Fire/Ice/Lightning Dmg. To exploit SK taking more Phys when hit by ele dmg or break shields based on number of hits.
5. Activating skills costs less SP - Occasionally needed on valks. Good example is Kikaku DP. Don't gimp yourself out of Margrave condition.
Final note: affixes can be 2-diamond or 3-diamond. 3-diamond goes up to 23 Atk per affix, up to 5.6% Crit Dmg.
