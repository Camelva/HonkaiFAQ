# All about Stamina Regen
tags: stamina regen

- gain `300` stamina per day for free
- `300 = 10 per hour x 24 hours + 30 (mei lunch) + 30 (mei dinner)`
- paying `25` crystals for `60` stam is not good if you're on a budget
- ~~adventure commander is a good deal~~ (stamina pot subscription removed)
- avoid letting your stamina exceed the denominator, i.e. for `X/Y` stam, `X` should be be kept smaller than `Y`.
- when `X >= Y` ("overcapped"), stamina regen is no longer `10` per hour. instead, it is `10 x 35% = 3.5` per hour. (yours may be greater than `35%`)
- `Y = your captain level + 80`
- the absolute max value of `X = your captain level + 560`
