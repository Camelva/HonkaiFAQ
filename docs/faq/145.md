## How to unlink account
tags: unbind, unlink

Because it's linked to a different HYv account than the one you're logging into

CS can help you figure that out

If you use the Account Recovery option in-game and it says that you failed to link because "Honkai Impact 3rd character" is already linked, and you don't remember the HoYoverse login you linked with, or it says the HoYoverse account you're trying to link with is already linked then send an email like this:

```
Subject: Account Retrieval
Body: UID and screenshot of failed to link screen
```

Send the email to one of these emails depending on the server your account is on (please don't send an email to each email or multiple times):


【GLB Server】:
```
honkai3rd_global@hoyoverse.com
```
【SEA server】:
```
honkai3rd_asia@hoyoverse.com
```
【繁中服】：
```
twbh3@pwbplay.com
```

If you don't want to unlink and want to recover your account, don't fill out the form you get sent and just wait for CS.
