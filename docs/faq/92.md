# Quick usage guide: Valkyrie Gloria (VG)

- Ult. Evasion can be followed with A Evade A Evade A Evade A sequence. Up to 5x A if fast. Each A restores bar and applies Ignite Trauma.
- Gather bar to be able to hold A for running atk, with a strong finisher and applies Ignite Trauma. Needs only 1 bar and usually recommended to not wait until 2 bars.
- After using the Ult, hold A to consume bar for lots of damage. Bar regen is also faster.
- Best is Sagittarius Astra and Leeuwenhoek TB Thales M.
- Not at all a relevant fire DPS and practically zero chance of getting better in the future.
