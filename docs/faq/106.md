what to buy from witch's corridor
- see [!faq shop](/faq/35)
- wo => ncc
- pwo => stamps, frags of non-farmable S-ranks, wafer stabilizer, wafer dataflow

farming ncc
- farming wo to buy ncc is the largest f2p source of ncc
- 300 wo => 300 ncc
- expeditions for ns, va, vb, ya are 36 stam for at least 60 wo, recommended to do at least ns, va every day once you max dorm level
- from battle arsenal, gold pins => dj frags => wo => ncc has the same rate as gold pins => ncc
- memorial arena eggs can be used for frags for ncc, but I recommend this only after you've SSS-ed all of the valks
