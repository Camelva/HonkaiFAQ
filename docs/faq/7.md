## QTE Timers
tags: qte

When you perform a QTE skill, it doubles the cooldown for the valk switching out. So if valk A is on field and you QTE to valk B, you must wait twice as long before valk A can come back onto the field (4s with no QTE vs 8s with qte).

That's why you don't want to QTE from your damage dealer to a support, and you should generally turn off the QTE skill for the support that comes in right after your damage dealer.
