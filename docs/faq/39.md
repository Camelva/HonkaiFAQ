## What is Blood Dance Holder?
**Blood Dance holder** is a general name for any greatsword user, who can equip **Blood Dance** weapon. **Blood Dance** itself is a strong elemental support weapon, but niche because of low duration. 

## How to pick best user?
The best Blood Dance (BD) holder depends on the team and situation. The main factors to consider are the following:
- **Time fracture:**

    In MA it may be useful to use a BD holder that has time fracture on evasion, e.g. MC and BS.
- **Switch skills:**

    Valkyries with no switch skill (e.g. VK, MC, BB) can be better BD holders since they won't apply JST/newt B prematurely with switch in attacks.
- **QTE skills:**

    QTE skills can be useful to provide time fracture and further trigger the QTE of your dps (e.g. SF).
- **Typing:**

    Sometimes you need a BD holder of a particular type in order to satisfy lead skills, e.g. use a psy BD holder for LE HF team and for HoT teams, or use a BD holder whose type will satisfy AE lead in applicable teams.
