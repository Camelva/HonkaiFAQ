# How Time Fracture works
tags: tf

### Time Slow
Time Slow is a status effect that greatly slows the target. This also extends any applicable debuffs on the target by slowing down the counter for them. Newton, Mei, and all of CH's impair methods are not applicable, for example; they don't get extended. Stuff like Mjolnir or DP impair does get extended.

### Time Lock
Time Lock temporarily freezes the target in time, immobilizing them completely as well as halting the timer for any applicable debuffs on them. It's basically a 100% Time Slow.

### Time Fracture
Time Fracture slows the entire world, applying time slow to all enemies and also slowing the game clock. This latter effect is incredibly important for Memorial Arena, where scores on bosses are determined by the game clock time.
