# How to get X faster?

any way to get x faster?
x = crystals/ancients/asterite/gold/stamina/other resources

- all resources are time-gated. you only get a certain amount per period. that is by design. mihoyo needs to make money.
- what you can do is optimize your own processes. optimize the way you spend stam by consulting [!faq stamina priority](/faq/152). make sure you do all events and dailies.
- of course, you can also whale (spend real money).
- there are also 1-time only crystals and other resources in story, but again these are 1-time, not sustainable, use if desperate. we have a count of this in !faq story crystals.
- for the earn rate, we have [!faq income](/faq/62), [!faq ancient](/faq/102). we don't have a good record of asterite income and gold income, but if you've tracked it feel free to share.
