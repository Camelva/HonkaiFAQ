## Topup Event
You spend x amount of money (yes real money) to b-chips or xtals  (though b -chips is better options than direct xtals but that's for a different day) to get to a milestone, usually this rewards you a box with stamps for 2 S rank valks i.e BK/AE HR/CH, though it can give stamps to awaken and non awakened suits.

these are the possible rewards you can obtain from it:
- 60 crystals/b-chips = special outfit coupon x6 , booster x5
- 300 crystals/b-chips = expansion supply card x1, booster x5

- 3280 crystals/b-chips = stamps box x1, material option type a x10
- 6480 crystals/b-chips = stamps box x2, material option type a x10

stamps box contain 1 stamp for non-awakening and 2 stamps for awakening;

material option type a lets you choose between phase shifter 1x or sc metal-h2 x3.
(both does not expire so take all the time you need and only use it if you need or know what to get).

> note: it doesn't take into account for first time bonuses, spending topped-up items or topping up outside of the event doesn't count towards it once it shows up it only accounts for what you topped-up during it, any form of top-up can contribute towards the milestones and if you didn't claim the rewards but have reached said milestones it will be delivered to you via mail
