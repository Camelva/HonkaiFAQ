tags: shop

### Logistics terminal (daily shop)
- nothing for crystals
- 1800 aster mind stones
- only deeply discounted aei and ps for aster, maybe not even
- b-rank valk frag for coins, even when maxed, for ncc
- elf part for coins, even when maxed, for ncc

### Exchange shop
- [its own faq](/faq/71)

### Dorm shop
- bp orb, 2 x 1600
- torus, 50 x 100
- ps, as many as possible
- i never buy the dorm supply card, but i still always max out spending event; you must have the resolve never to spend dorm supply card outside of spending events

### Witch's corridor
- only ncc for witch orb
- pure witch orb should be discussed together with aw

### Supply shop
- ncc is overwhelmingly good
- i can see a weak case for some stamps or elf frags but it's gotta be super compelling

### Elysian shop
- weekly phase shifter
- patch valk frag, even if maxed, for ncc
- weekly time swirl, spatial lens if desperately needed
- stamps after all of that

### War treasury
- [its own faq](/faq/1)

### Battle arsenal
- aei buy out
- metals buy out
- smelted cores only if necessary
- ncc buy out
- if sss dj, dj frags buy out for ncc
- ps only if necessary

### Co-op shop
- patch honkai cube
- buy out spirit jade
- upgrade your divine keys
- buy out mind stones
- buy out phase shifters

### Mirage store
- 1 aster time swirl
- time swirl for time structures only after you need not reset soulium raid
- time swirl for ranger creds not good
- reroll devices... i sometimes use them because i gotta settle sometimes for mediocre affixes

### Armada terminal

- honkai cube

### Asterite shop
