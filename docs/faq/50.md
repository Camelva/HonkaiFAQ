Expect advice about battlesuits and equipment to be based on objectively measurable factors, i.e. parts of the game where a meaningful performance-based score is awarded. This means Abyss, Memorial Arena, and Elysian Realm. We can't give advice based on subjective factors like appearance or fun-ness. We also don't evaluate battlesuits and equipment based on parts of the game where the selection is inconsequential, like story mode.
