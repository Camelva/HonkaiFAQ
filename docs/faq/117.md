## What makes HoS so good?
tags: hos why

1) Despite being primarily a support, she can DPS very well, especially early on.
2) She can consistently give you 50% impair via her spear Combo Attack.
3) She can also give you 75% impair on Ultimate, making her impair one of the strongest in the game. 
4) Strong gather too, and can gather via multiple means which makes her great for mobs in Abyss.
5)HoS has the ability to easily Time Lock, which can proc the QTEs of the majority of DPS.
6) She does not need gacha gear to function as urgently as most modern Valkyires.
7) Her Evasion Skill can be triggered without needing to Ultimate Evade, meaning you don't need the enemy to hit for you to proc Time Fracture QTE's or start Memorial Arena Rotations. However, enemies need to be in hit range of the clone's explosion to trigger the Evasion Skill.
8) The aforementioned Evasion Skill also restores up to 15 SP for all team members.
9) During Ultimate, HoS can trigger stig effects even when off the field.
10) She has a shield that can reduce damage taken, boost ignore interrupt, and give team crit damage.
11) HoS is currently the only support Valkyire capable of using SSwords, a very broken support Stigmata set.

HoS is capable of doing everything listed above at S0 with no gacha gear. Considering most of these things can't even be established by other Valkyires even with their ranks or gear, she's a must-pull for everyone!
