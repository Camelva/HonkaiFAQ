### Acvite buffs
Active buffs are ones when you unlock the gene limit for this dkeys in order to do this simply do either dorm > divine key > gene limit or when you enter abyss or MA look for a flaming sword icon left to the start button

This are the active buffs that are present (this will be assuming max level dkey room):
- Corruption - gain 8% phys dmg or gain 4% crit rate when combo over 30
- Destruction - gain 8% fire dmg or gain 6% tdm in burst mode
- Domination - gain 8% ice dmg or gain 1.6 more sp on basic/charged atks (cooldown of 4s)
- Binding - gain 8% lightning dmg or gain 1.6 more sp on basic/combo atks (cooldown of 4s)

### Passive buffs
Passive buffs are permanently added stats on your valkyries which can be gained when either leveling up the dkey category or when syncing dkeys

The buffs for all the categories are as follow:
- Binding - 15 def, 30 hp and 10 crt; 10 atk instead if sync
- Corruption - 20 hp, 5 atk, 40 def and 5 crt
- Creation - 20 hp; 10 atk if sync
