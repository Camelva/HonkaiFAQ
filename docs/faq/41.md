## Awakened valks
tags: awaken

The "Awakened" class of valks are essentially a seperate battlesuit that is linked to its "Unawakened" valk  (e.g. HoV = Awakened, KMB = Non-awakened)
Valks that share a link share levels, some skills, and cannot be used in the same team.

What isn't shared are some skills, Valkyrie rank, and gear. Despite not sharing rank, it can sometimes be useful to rank up one valk to unlock a shared skill on the other.

Awakened Valkyries take more resources to rank up, and increase their skills.

Note that despite the title of "Awakening", Awakened valks are not direct improvements to their unawakened counterparts, take it as simply the Awakening/Unawakened valkyries simply being linked on some qualities, but otherwise being completely seperate battlesuits
