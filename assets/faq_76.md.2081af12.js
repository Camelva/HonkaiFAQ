This is because Masters Abyss included players lv 70 to 85 (with 85 being the former max level), where players lv 81 to 85 had PRI-ARMs. Thus, passing lv 70 was an enormous spike in competition, and it was impossible to place high enough to match the rewards obtained from Elites (lv 56 to 69).</p><p>However, that is since changed, and now Masters, regardless of Abyss or Arena, comprises lv 70 to 80 players only. It is &quot;like entering Elites again&quot;.</p><p>Regardless of your skill level, moving up a tier will result in an increase in Crystal gain. For example, a player who retains Agony in Elites is likely to retain Agony in Masters. At the very least, the player will alternate between Sinful and Agony. Both situations reward more Crystals than retaining Agony in Elites.</p><p>Looking at it from another angle, a 180-day player who level rushed is far more likely to retain Red Lotus in Masters than a 180-day player who didn&#39;t. The two players may have tried to farm the same gear, but the player who used Exp Chips is higher level and so has more attack, and the player has also earned more rewards (e.g. Ancient Willpower, Crystals) in the 180 days thanks to entering better-rewarding tiers earlier.</p><p>Furthermore, if your intention is to break through, it is better to enter Exalted (lv 81+) as soon as possible to begin farming PRI-ARM upgrade mats.</p><h3 id="what-is-breaking-through" tabindex="-1">What is breaking through? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-breaking-through" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><ul><li>Starting from lv 80 you can choose whether to &quot;break the ceiling&quot;, which allows you to advance to level 81.

These rewards include Crystals, Ancient Legacy, and Ancient Willpower.</li><li>Hoyoverse frequently updates Exalted Abyss with new bosses and weathers, whereas Masters Abyss gets updated more slowly.
