Go to Dorm &gt; Expeditions to deploy Valkyries to auto-run expedition stages for you.</p><p>Every Valkyrie has multiple &quot;Acts&quot; (stages) and each Act has either 2 or 3 max attempts per day.

This pity count remains even if you don&#39;t use all attempts in one day.</p><p>Different Acts also cost different amounts of stamina to run so you want to run the more cost-effective Acts first. Since the pity is 2 for some Acts and 3 for others, it&#39;s not as simple as running Acts that cost less stamina.

It is essentially a custom Supply in which you can pick 5 weapons and 5 stigma sets out of a predetermined pool of gear. You can roll on Firepower once during the period where it\u2019s available, and it will guarantee you one gear piece that you don\u2019t have already have in your collection (or in other words, haven\u2019t owned at any point).</p><h3 id="is-firepower-supply-worth-it" tabindex="-1"><strong>Is Firepower Supply worth it?</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-firepower-supply-worth-it" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>If Firepower Supply is worth rolling depends entirely on the state of your account.</p><p>It is recommended to roll Firepower Supply if you can select 9 weapons/stigma sets that are already in your collection and one gear piece you don\u2019t already have, hence narrowing your pool essentially to that one gear piece. The best use of your guarantee is on a Divine Key for the universal buffs, or a weapon which rotates into supply with a forgable set (ex: Hekate) so you avoid having to roll for forgable stigmata, or the last piece of a gear set that you already have 3/4 of and are just missing the last piece. In other words, it\u2019s most effectively used to dodge having to roll on a normal Supply in the future entirely if you feel you need the gear from it.</p><p>However, it is NOT recommended to roll Firepower Supply if your gear collection is too small to be able to snipe one gear piece of your choosing via the method mentioned above, or if you just simply don\u2019t feel the need for any of the featured gear from it. As I mentioned before, the best way to use Firepower is by using it to avoid having to roll on another Supply later. If you use Firepower Supply to get something like your first piece of a set, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll just get a duplicate of whatever piece you rolled anyway while going for the rest of it.</p><h3 id="tldr" tabindex="-1"><strong>TLDR:</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#tldr" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Firepower Supply is worth it for established accounts that can snipe a gear piece of their choosing, but not worth for those who can\u2019t.</p><h2 id="understanding-impair-\u8106\u5F31" tabindex="-1">Understanding Impair (&quot;\u8106\u5F31&quot;) <a class="header-anchor" href="#understanding-impair-\u8106\u5F31" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>tags: impair</p><ol><li>Enemies have DEF. Many Ex MA bosses have <code>DEF = 996</code>. The result of DEF on damage is that a factor of <code>1 / (1 + (DEF / (300 + 20 * lv)))</code> is multiplied to any damage when the damage is physical. This multiplier is called phys resist effect. lv is the level of the attacking valk. I&#39;ll use <code>lv = 80</code> for this FAQ, thus <code>phys resist effect = 1900 / (1900 + DEF)</code>. For example, when <code>DEF = 1000</code>, <code>phys resist effect = 0.655</code>, i.e. <code>0.655</code> is multiplied to any physical damage.</li><li>If it helps, <code>1 - ele resist = ele resist effect</code> is multiplied to any ele damage just like how <code>1 - phys resist = phys resist effect</code> is multiplied to any phys damage.</li><li>Impair is a reduction in <code>DEF</code>, i.e. Impair is a percentage that is deducted.

We can also deduce that dmg increase as a result of impair is <code>Impair * DEF / (1900 + (1 - Impair) * DEF)</code>. For <code>DEF = 1000</code> and <code>75%</code> Impair, that&#39;s <code>750 / (1900 + 250) = 0.349</code>, which makes sense, as <code>1.349 * 0.655 = 0.884</code>.</li><li>Impair is always expressed as a percentage.
