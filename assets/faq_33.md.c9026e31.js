Some valks, like KMB and GK (HoV), can trigger their Evasion Skill with their evasion action without performing an ultimate evade.</p><h3 id="ultimate-evasion-ue" tabindex="-1">Ultimate Evasion (UE) <a class="header-anchor" href="#ultimate-evasion-ue" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Ultimate Evasion is using Evasion Action to dodge through an active hitbox. Specifically, the hitbox of the attack must come in contact with the Valkyrie&#39;s hurtbox. This distinction is important, as there are valks whose Evasion Actions can actually dodge hitboxes entirely, such as Roza&#39;s - if she outright avoids the attack by teleporting underneath it, it will not trigger an Ultimate Evasion.</p><h3 id="perfect-defense" tabindex="-1">Perfect Defense <a class="header-anchor" href="#perfect-defense" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>If the Valkyrie instead puts up a shield, then depending on the mechanism for defending, there are variants of this for those Valkyries. Bronya performs Perfect Defense when you shield an attack then immediately drop the shield after the attack is blocked. BK has a unique Retaliation mechanic in addition to a standard dash-type evasion action.</p><h3 id="evasion-skill" tabindex="-1">Evasion Skill <a class="header-anchor" href="#evasion-skill" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Evasion Skill is an ability tied to evasion.
