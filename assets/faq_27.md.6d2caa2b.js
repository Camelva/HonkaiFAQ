This also extends any applicable debuffs on the target by slowing down the counter for them. Newton, Mei, and all of CH&#39;s impair methods are not applicable, for example; they don&#39;t get extended. Stuff like Mjolnir or DP impair does get extended.</p><h3 id="time-lock" tabindex="-1">Time Lock <a class="header-anchor" href="#time-lock" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Time Lock temporarily freezes the target in time, immobilizing them completely as well as halting the timer for any applicable debuffs on them.

This latter effect is incredibly important for Memorial Arena, where scores on bosses are determined by the game clock time.</p>',8),l=[o];function s(n,c,m,d,h,f){return a(),t("div",null,l)}const _=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,_ as default};
