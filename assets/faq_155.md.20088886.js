It is the sum of score increases across every game mode that matters that I would expect each week, as a consequence of the investment. (If you like, you can weigh each category based on how much it matters to you, e.g. if you don&#39;t care about MA, you can give it 0 weight, i.e. not count it.)</p><p>Here&#39;s how to use this metric. For this example, I only consider Abyss, because it&#39;s easier to explain.</p><ul><li>For a new damage valk, I can expect to use it about once every 2 or 3 cycles, with a 40-point increase over its next best alternative, so in a week that&#39;s a 40 point increase total. This decreases sharply over time as Mihoyo promotes other valks.</li><li>For a new Divine Key with global 10 Atk, I expect it to boost my score by ~8 every cycle, so 16 points per week, forever.</li><li>For a new support valk, I expect to use it about once every 2 or 3 cycles, with a 30-point increase over its next best alternative. However, I will continue to use it for longer and in more teams.</li></ul><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>For Memorial Arena, you can apply similar analysis.
