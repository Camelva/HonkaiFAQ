There are currently 7 dkey categories with their respective dkeys:</p><p>Key of Binding - Oath of Judah, Pledge of Sakura Key of Creation - Abyss flower, Abyss Key of Corruption - Jizo Mitama Key of Domination - Grips of TaiXuan, XuanYuan Sword Key of Destruction - Judgement of Shamash, Cleaver of Shamash, Might of An-Utu Key of Devouring - Star of Eden, Twins of Eden Key of Sentience - Fenghuang Down, Fenghuang Pinions note: just because it has key in the name doesn&#39;t mean its a dkey (kov/koc/koo/kor are NOT dkeys)</p><p>You can get active or passive buffs from this, active buffs like gain x ice dmg passive buffs like gain x atk, you need to upgrade the divine key weapon if you want to upgrade its buffs in the divine key room (with the exception of Creation/Devouring/Sentience since there max levels are 1 and you don&#39;t need to upgrade them at all)</p><p>Syncing and Upgrading To sync a dkey you need to own 2 or more dkeys that are in the same category, I.E have both judgement of shamash and cleaver of shamash to do sync 1 for destruction (if you own utu then its sync 2) it doesn&#39;t cost anything to do this. Upgrading a dkey can mean 2 things either its the actual weapon level like lvl 50 gtx or the dkey lvl the max of which is 10, tho you get all the passive buffs at lvl 8. Spirit jade, adv skill matz and smelted cores are needed to upgrade dkey lvl in the room, while for the actual weapon its spirit jade, shifters and soulium (lvl 45 if u want to max passive, 50 if u want to get active)</p><p>For your upgrade paths do Gtx to 50 -&gt; j.shamash to 50 -&gt; jizo to 50, gtx first as it has the highest atk gain you can get for a single dkey and is the most useful raid weapon since it can be outside of its buffs</p><p>\u304A\u75B2\u308C\u69D8 \u3067\u3057\u305F Vampy n ZeroBlade</p><blockquote><p>Update with 7T and SoEW</p></blockquote>',9),s=[n];function r(d,h,u,c,f,l){return a(),t("div",null,s)}const g=e(i,[["render",r]]);export{y as __pageData,g as default};
