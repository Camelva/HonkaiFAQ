As an example, Thales M gives 2% host fire taken per stack, up to 10 stacks.

You can find expeditions by going to Attack &gt; Story &gt; Expeditions tab. Completing an expedition stage has a chance of dropping a fragment of the target Valkyrie. Go to Dorm &gt; Expeditions to deploy Valkyries to auto-run expedition stages for you.</p><p>Every Valkyrie has multiple &quot;Acts&quot; (stages) and each Act has either 2 or 3 max attempts per day. The number of max attempts is also the pity counter, i.e. for a 2-attempt Act you&#39;re guaranteed at least one fragment every 2 runs, and for a 3-attempt Act you&#39;re guaranteed at least one fragment every 3 runs. This pity count remains even if you don&#39;t use all attempts in one day.</p><p>Different Acts also cost different amounts of stamina to run so you want to run the more cost-effective Acts first. Since the pity is 2 for some Acts and 3 for others, it&#39;s not as simple as running Acts that cost less stamina. Instead multiply the stamina cost by the number of max attempts to get the stamina cost to guarantee a fragment. Then run the stages that have the lowest cost first.</p><h2 id="fragments" tabindex="-1">Fragments <a class="header-anchor" href="#fragments" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>tags: frag, frags</p><h3 id="to-get-more-valkyrie-fragments" tabindex="-1">To get more Valkyrie Fragments <a class="header-anchor" href="#to-get-more-valkyrie-fragments" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>For suits you don&#39;t own: Menu &gt; Valkyries &gt; tap the one you don&#39;t own &gt; tap Get.

The one place where HoV was meta up until Silverwing&#39;s release was Ranged weather Assaka boss in Superstring Dimension (EX Abyss), but due to temperatures being extremely high nowadays, Assaka&#39;s shield in that stage has become a big problem especially when we take into consideration the very tiny delay that shield has until it completely regenerates, therefore you&#39;re better off using Silverwing to completely bypass the shield, thanks to her elemental damage.</p><p><em>Note: This FAQ was written by an SSS HoV user.</em></p><h2 id="abbreviations" tabindex="-1">Abbreviations <a class="header-anchor" href="#abbreviations" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>tags: abbr, abbreviations, glossary</p><p><a href="https://honkaiimpact3.gamepedia.com/Glossary_of_Terms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://honkaiimpact3.gamepedia.com/Glossary_of_Terms</a></p><h2 id="how-time-fracture-works" tabindex="-1">How Time Fracture works <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-time-fracture-works" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>tags: tf</p><h3 id="time-slow" tabindex="-1">Time Slow <a class="header-anchor" href="#time-slow" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Time Slow is a status effect that greatly slows the target. This also extends any applicable debuffs on the target by slowing down the counter for them. Newton, Mei, and all of CH&#39;s impair methods are not applicable, for example; they don&#39;t get extended. Stuff like Mjolnir or DP impair does get extended.</p><h3 id="time-lock" tabindex="-1">Time Lock <a class="header-anchor" href="#time-lock" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Time Lock temporarily freezes the target in time, immobilizing them completely as well as halting the timer for any applicable debuffs on them.

Some valks, like KMB and GK (HoV), can trigger their Evasion Skill with their evasion action without performing an ultimate evade.</p><p>Ultimate Evasion is using Evasion Action to dodge through an active hitbox. Specifically, the hitbox of the attack must come in contact with the Valkyrie&#39;s hurtbox. This distinction is important, as there are valks whose Evasion Actions can actually dodge hitboxes entirely, such as Roza&#39;s - if she outright avoids the attack by teleporting underneath it, it will not trigger an Ultimate Evasion.</p><p>If the Valkyrie instead puts up a shield, then depending on the mechanism for defending, there are variants of this for those Valkyries. Bronya performs Perfect Defense when you shield an attack then immediately drop the shield after the attack is blocked. BK has a unique Retaliation mechanic in addition to a standard dash-type evasion action.</p><p>Evasion Skill is an ability tied to evasion. For most valks, it activates automatically if it is not on CD and you perform an Ultimate Evasion or Perfect Defense.</p><p>Evadion is built by either performing Retaliation, Perfect Defense, or an Ultimate Evasion - however, Ultimate Evasions can only earn Evadion once per internal evasion cooldown for that character.</p><h2 id="what-to-get-from-an-s-rank-egg-outdated" tabindex="-1">What to Get From an S Rank Egg?

This is because Masters Abyss included players lv 70 to 85 (with 85 being the former max level), where players lv 81 to 85 had PRI-ARMs. Thus, passing lv 70 was an enormous spike in competition, and it was impossible to place high enough to match the rewards obtained from Elites (lv 56 to 69).</p><p>However, that is since changed, and now Masters, regardless of Abyss or Arena, comprises lv 70 to 80 players only. It is &quot;like entering Elites again&quot;.</p><p>Regardless of your skill level, moving up a tier will result in an increase in Crystal gain. For example, a player who retains Agony in Elites is likely to retain Agony in Masters. At the very least, the player will alternate between Sinful and Agony. Both situations reward more Crystals than retaining Agony in Elites.</p><p>Looking at it from another angle, a 180-day player who level rushed is far more likely to retain Red Lotus in Masters than a 180-day player who didn&#39;t. The two players may have tried to farm the same gear, but the player who used Exp Chips is higher level and so has more attack, and the player has also earned more rewards (e.g. Ancient Willpower, Crystals) in the 180 days thanks to entering better-rewarding tiers earlier.</p><p>Furthermore, if your intention is to break through, it is better to enter Exalted (lv 81+) as soon as possible to begin farming PRI-ARM upgrade mats.</p><h3 id="what-is-breaking-through" tabindex="-1">What is breaking through? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-breaking-through" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><ul><li>Starting from lv 80 you can choose whether to &quot;break the ceiling&quot;, which allows you to advance to level 81.

It is essentially a custom Supply in which you can pick 5 weapons and 5 stigma sets out of a predetermined pool of gear. You can roll on Firepower once during the period where it\u2019s available, and it will guarantee you one gear piece that you don\u2019t have already have in your collection (or in other words, haven\u2019t owned at any point).</p><h3 id="is-firepower-supply-worth-it" tabindex="-1"><strong>Is Firepower Supply worth it?</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-firepower-supply-worth-it" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>If Firepower Supply is worth rolling depends entirely on the state of your account.</p><p>It is recommended to roll Firepower Supply if you can select 9 weapons/stigma sets that are already in your collection and one gear piece you don\u2019t already have, hence narrowing your pool essentially to that one gear piece. The best use of your guarantee is on a Divine Key for the universal buffs, or a weapon which rotates into supply with a forgable set (ex: Hekate) so you avoid having to roll for forgable stigmata, or the last piece of a gear set that you already have 3/4 of and are just missing the last piece. In other words, it\u2019s most effectively used to dodge having to roll on a normal Supply in the future entirely if you feel you need the gear from it.</p><p>However, it is NOT recommended to roll Firepower Supply if your gear collection is too small to be able to snipe one gear piece of your choosing via the method mentioned above, or if you just simply don\u2019t feel the need for any of the featured gear from it. As I mentioned before, the best way to use Firepower is by using it to avoid having to roll on another Supply later. If you use Firepower Supply to get something like your first piece of a set, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll just get a duplicate of whatever piece you rolled anyway while going for the rest of it.</p><h3 id="tldr" tabindex="-1"><strong>TLDR:</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#tldr" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Firepower Supply is worth it for established accounts that can snipe a gear piece of their choosing, but not worth for those who can\u2019t.</p><h2 id="understanding-impair-\u8106\u5F31" tabindex="-1">Understanding Impair (&quot;\u8106\u5F31&quot;) <a class="header-anchor" href="#understanding-impair-\u8106\u5F31" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>tags: impair</p><ol><li>Enemies have DEF. Many Ex MA bosses have <code>DEF = 996</code>. The result of DEF on damage is that a factor of <code>1 / (1 + (DEF / (300 + 20 * lv)))</code> is multiplied to any damage when the damage is physical. This multiplier is called phys resist effect. lv is the level of the attacking valk. I&#39;ll use <code>lv = 80</code> for this FAQ, thus <code>phys resist effect = 1900 / (1900 + DEF)</code>. For example, when <code>DEF = 1000</code>, <code>phys resist effect = 0.655</code>, i.e. <code>0.655</code> is multiplied to any physical damage.</li><li>If it helps, <code>1 - ele resist = ele resist effect</code> is multiplied to any ele damage just like how <code>1 - phys resist = phys resist effect</code> is multiplied to any phys damage.</li><li>Impair is a reduction in <code>DEF</code>, i.e. Impair is a percentage that is deducted.

We can also deduce that dmg increase as a result of impair is <code>Impair * DEF / (1900 + (1 - Impair) * DEF)</code>. For <code>DEF = 1000</code> and <code>75%</code> Impair, that&#39;s <code>750 / (1900 + 250) = 0.349</code>, which makes sense, as <code>1.349 * 0.655 = 0.884</code>.</li><li>Impair is always expressed as a percentage.

However, the key difference is that EXPA allows you to choose the uprate Valkyrie from a predetermined pool. These have 3 Valkyries to choose from. Once you select a Valkyrie, you are guaranteed to pull her as the S rank (guaranteed S rank is still at 100 pulls). For example, they may give you the choice between HoS, HFs, and AE, which means you can choose which one of the 3 is the uprate. The uprate Valkyrie selected can be changed up to 5 times. The A ranks available are the same across selections and only S ranks change. Pity resets if you have acquired the S rank Valkyrie.</p><h3 id="foca" tabindex="-1">FOCA <a class="header-anchor" href="#foca" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>FOCA Select contains 5 gear sets you can choose as uprate from a pool. For example, you may be able to choose between HoS\u2019s signature gear, HFs\u2019s signature gear, and so on. You can change what gear you have selected up to 10 times. The sets you do not choose as uprate will still be on the supply as off rates. There is a guarantee only for the uprate weapon at 60 pulls, however, no such guarantees exist for stigmata on this supply. The aforementioned weapon guarantee will reset once you either pull the weapon or change your selected gear. To clarify, this means that if you select one set of gear as uprate, then you change your selection to another set, the pity will reset back to 60.

Who you use depends on a lot of things like the game mode, your gear options, the Weather (essentially a system where certain Valkyire/damage types are buffed or debuffed) if you\u2019re fighting in Abyss, and of course what Valkyires you have available!</p><p>The normal structure for teams is one damage dealer (DPS) and two supports there to boost your DPS\u2019s strength. If you run multiple DPS, they\u2019ll just be fighting each other for field time since they don\u2019t do anything when off field. If you run 3 supports, you won\u2019t have anyone for your support\u2019s skills to boost. An easy way to tell if a Valkyire is a support is to read through their skills and see if they have anything that boosts their teammates damage. For example, if a Valkyire has a skill that boosts her teammates ice damage, then she\u2019s most likely an ice support.</p><p>Some teams, usually ones which are reliant on things like Time Fracture and fast rotations, are better suited for Memorial Arena while others with slower rotations or less Time Fracture may be better suited for abyss. If you don\u2019t know if a Valkyire/team is more suited for Abyss or Memorial Arena, just ask!</p><p>For more details on how to build teams, check out this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3H0-4c0L9o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3H0-4c0L9o</a></p><p><strong>You can also ask questions about what team you should build from scratch, but make sure you include information about what Valkyires you have, how good their gear is, what gamemode you\u2019re in, what you\u2019re trying to fight, and what the Weather is if you\u2019re in Abyss. We can\u2019t help you if you ask for a \u201Cgeneral\u201D team since every Valkyire/team covers different things.</strong></p><h2 id="what-is-augmented-battlesuits" tabindex="-1">What is Augmented Battlesuits <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-augmented-battlesuits" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Not all battlesuits can be augmented, but some of it can.
