Many Ex MA bosses have <code>DEF = 996</code>. The result of DEF on damage is that a factor of <code>1 / (1 + (DEF / (300 + 20 * lv)))</code> is multiplied to any damage when the damage is physical. This multiplier is called phys resist effect. lv is the level of the attacking valk. I&#39;ll use <code>lv = 80</code> for this FAQ, thus <code>phys resist effect = 1900 / (1900 + DEF)</code>. For example, when <code>DEF = 1000</code>, <code>phys resist effect = 0.655</code>, i.e. <code>0.655</code> is multiplied to any physical damage.</li><li>If it helps, <code>1 - ele resist = ele resist effect</code> is multiplied to any ele damage just like how <code>1 - phys resist = phys resist effect</code> is multiplied to any phys damage.</li><li>Impair is a reduction in <code>DEF</code>, i.e. Impair is a percentage that is deducted. Let&#39;s say Impair is <code>75%</code> (e.g. CH Ult), so where <code>DEF = 1000</code> before Impair, now <code>DEF = 250</code> and <code>phys resist effect = 1900 / (1900 + 250) = 0.884</code>.</li><li><code>0.884</code> is a lot better than the <code>0.655</code> from before Impair! We can also deduce that dmg increase as a result of impair is <code>Impair * DEF / (1900 + (1 - Impair) * DEF)</code>. For <code>DEF = 1000</code> and <code>75%</code> Impair, that&#39;s <code>750 / (1900 + 250) = 0.349</code>, which makes sense, as <code>1.349 * 0.655 = 0.884</code>.</li><li>Impair is always expressed as a percentage. As far as is known, all sources of Impair replace previous Impair, except when it says &quot;Impair only when not Impaired&quot;, in which case it does nothing. (Only 1 source of Impair can be alive.)</li><li><strong>BONUS</strong> Herrscher of Sentience&#39;s ultimate can be thought of as constantly refreshing it&#39;s own impair, thus it takes priority over any other impairs that might be applied for it&#39;s duration.</li></ol>',3),d=[o];function c(r,n,l,p,h,m){return i(),a("div",null,d)}const _=e(s,[["render",c]]);export{u as __pageData,_ as default};
