AE has 14% Ele Breach, so bosses with 31% ele resist have 17% ele resist after 14% Ele Breach.</li><li>To illustrate the impact of Ele Breach, 31% ele resist with 14% Ele Breach results in <code>83 / 69 = 1.203</code> times more damage. 72% ele resist with 14% Ele Breach results in <code>42 / 28 = 1.5</code> times more damage. In summary, damage increase as a result of having Ele Breach is <code>Ele Breach / (1 - ele resist)</code></li><li>Each source of Ele Breach is subtracted from ele resist. For example, 14% from AE Ult and 20% from HR Ult (total 34%) results in Jizo having 38% ele resist and bosses with 31% ele resist having 0 ele resist. Note that ele resist cannot be negative, so Ele Breach is no longer useful once ele resist has been reduced to 0.</li></ol><blockquote><p>Elemental Breach is additive with Reduced Elemental Resistence</p></blockquote><h3 id="understanding-physical-breach-\u7269\u7406\u7A7F\u900F" tabindex="-1">Understanding Physical Breach (&quot;\u7269\u7406\u7A7F\u900F&quot;) <a class="header-anchor" href="#understanding-physical-breach-\u7269\u7406\u7A7F\u900F" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><ol><li>Physical Breach is, at the time of writing, a concept only available in Elysian Realm.</li><li>Physical Breach does not behave like Ele Breach.

What makes Physical Breach different than impair, is that breach is a valkyrie stat instead of a debuff like impair. This means they &quot;stack&quot; but with a greatly dimminshed effectiveness. Physical Breach and Impair also stack additively with DEF reduction, which is uncommon, but found in Elysian Realm as well. If you get to 100% in any combination, any more is useless.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>So 40% DEF Reduction and 60% physical Breach is the same thing as 100% pBreach.
